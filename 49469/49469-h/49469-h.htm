<p class="center">The story of an exciting race, incidentally giving one a vivid glimpse of the humours of an
Australian bush meeting in the 'seventies.

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">I have</span> never been a jockey, but I
have ridden races under divers circumstances,
having&mdash;as is the case
with most of us Australians&mdash;put in
a considerable time in the saddle
one way and another.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption"><p>THE AUTHOR, MR. C.C. PALTRIDGE.
<em>From a Photograph.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>My people have been mixed up more or less
with racing ever since it started in our State&mdash;two
uncles and a cousin have been crack
amateurs over the "big sticks," and my brother
and myself have each done his little bit in the
same direction, though never attaining to notice
in the cities. My own riding has been confined
principally to obscure bush meetings,
and undertaken on the
spur of the moment, generally
as a substitute for an absent or
"hocussed" jockey.</p>

<p>This was the case at Orroroo,
then a newly-surveyed and
only partially-settled district in
the north of South Australia,
and the episode took place at
the very first meeting held in
that now prosperous and comparatively
populous community.</p>

<p>Let me describe the scene,
for probably few readers of this
magazine outside Australia have
ever beheld anything like it,
though many of the middle-aged
and old men "down
under" will slap their thighs
and say, "Jove! I've seen it
hundreds of times."</p>

<p>Picture to yourself first of all a wide, undulating
plain, dotted here and there with clumps of
needle-bush growing in loose reddish sand, with
lignum and ti-tree not altogether absent, while
in the distance could be seen the mingled greens
and blues of the salt-bush and blue-bush.
Beyond that, miles away, was a long semi-circular
line of black&mdash;the untouched acacia
scrub.</p>

<p>In such a scene as this were gathered, one day
in 1877, a small crowd of two or three hundred
men, a sprinkling of women and children, and a
multitude of dogs, while horses of every size,
shape, and colour, from the great draught stallion,
brought there to advertise his points to the new
settlers, to the slim, clean-limbed thoroughbred,
whose business was to make the sport, were tied
to trees or being led up and down, awaiting
their turn to run. Rogues and vagabonds of
every description were among that small crowd&mdash;three-card
men, purse-trick men, and all the
lower strata of the criminal class, for in those
days the bush race-meeting was a small goldmine
to men for whom the cities and larger
towns had become temporarily too warm.</p>

<p>The course was a circle of
about a mile and a quarter in
circumference, marked out by
flags on either side, the jumps
for the steeplechase&mdash;four sets
of three stiff panels of post and
rail&mdash;being erected just inside
the inner flags. The race consisted
of three heats of one
mile each, run at intervals
during the day, the riders, of
course, weighing out every time.</p>

<p>I will not detail the events
on the flat, from the maidens
to the hurry-scurry; they passed
off uneventfully amid the usual
good-natured enthusiasm of a
crowd of rough men out for
a day's fun.</p>

<p>Just as the saddling-bell&mdash;a
kerosene tin beaten with a
stick&mdash;rang for the first heat of
the steeplechase, Brady, the owner of a horse
called Barmaid, came up to my uncle, whom
I had accompanied to the meeting, and hurriedly
whispered in his ear.</p>

<p>"Never!" cried my uncle, in amazement.
"You don't mean it!"</p>

<p>"It is a fact," said Brady; "he's lying out
there in the ti-tree, absolutely helpless. We
nearly shook his teeth out, but he didn't move."</p>

<p>"Hocussed, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and if Lean didn't do it I'm a nigger,"
snapped Brady. "I told him not to even speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
to him, and yet he goes and actually drinks
with him! Confound him!" he added, viciously,
as he thought of his lost chance, for though the
horse Lean owned and was to ride, a big, raking
brown gelding called Pawnbroker, was favourite,
Brady's little bay mare was a clever fencer, and
had pace enough to lose his rival on the flat.
The stake, too, was twenty-five pounds, quite a
respectable sum for so small a meeting, and
Brady had his mare well backed.</p>

<p>Brady was the local publican, and, I believe,
an honest man, while Lean made his living by
going from meeting to meeting with his two
horses, generally winning or losing as best
suited his book, stopping at nothing that would
make the game pay. At least, that was his
reputation.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" asked my
uncle, presently.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Brady; "unless
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious, man!" interrupted my
uncle. "With my leg?" He had recently
broken it, and still needed a short stick to assist
him in walking. "Besides," he added, "I am
twelve stone, and you only want nine six."
Suddenly he turned abruptly to me. "Do you
want a ride, Charlie?"</p>

<p>"Ain't he too little?" objected Brady. "And
can he ride?"</p>

<p>"He can ride if he's game."</p>

<p>I felt a hot flush spread over my face and
alternate thrills of heat and cold run up and
down my body as something like fear gave place
to pleasure. At last, in a voice which, I am
afraid, was none too steady, I said, "I <em>am</em>
game."</p>

<p>I was promptly hurried away to a bough
"humpy," the only edifice of any kind on the
course, constructed of forked uprights supporting
a dozen short cross-pieces, or rafters, surmounted
by green gum-boughs and ti-tree; this
served as a drinking-booth (its chief purpose),
weighing-room, stewards' room, clerk's room, and
all the other offices required on a racecourse.
An ordinary steelyard, such as butchers use,
dangled from one of the rafters, to which was
fixed a stirrup. I placed my foot in this, having
previously donned a blue and yellow jacket and
cap, and clung on until the clerk of the scales
said, "Eight stone two." With a saddle and
bridle weighing twelve pounds I had to carry six
pounds of dead weight, made up partly of lead,
in the usual way, and partly by rolling up a big
rug and tying it on to the saddle, swag-fashion.</p>

<p>"It will help to keep you on, my boy," said
my uncle as he fixed it.</p>

<p>The crowd jeered good-temperedly at me as I
was led out. "Why don't you tie him on?"
said one.</p>

<p>"Going on the wallaby?" (tramping), inquired
another.</p>

<p>As we proceeded to the post, Brady addressed
me in low tones. "I don't want to frighten you,
sonny," he said; "but that Lean is a bad lot,
so don't let him be too close to you as you go
through the needle-bush. You'll be out of sight
there and he might pull you off; run just ahead
of him if you can, but don't have him alongside.
When you are going at the jumps let her pick
her own panel. Give her her head and sit
tight; she won't stop and she won't fall. And
win this heat if you can; it's two out of three,
you know." A moment later I was among the
half-dozen starters.</p>

<p>In a few minutes we were off, and I felt my
heart come up into my throat as, leading the
field, Barmaid took off at the first jump. Being
practically a child&mdash;I was only twelve years
old&mdash;I had not the hands of an expert, but I
managed to steady her a bit between the fences,
and, giving her her head at each obstacle, I
won that heat without being caught, Pawnbroker
being a not very close second. Two of
the others fell, and a third was still declining
the first fence when we finished.</p>

<p>In the second heat I was not permitted to
have things so much my own way. Lean
caught me at the first fence, and we rose and
landed together. I tried to get in front of
him, but he kept Pawnbroker's head at the
mare's shoulder and came on ever faster as I
increased the pace, and we took the next fence
at top speed. Lean had evidently thought I
should funk it and pull off; the rest of the
field were hopelessly behind.</p>

<p>Approaching the next fence, I foolishly
steadied the mare and dropped back to his
flank. This just suited him. We were racing
at the moment through a small belt of low
ti-tree, only our shoulders being visible to the
crowd. The next jump was in the clear, a few
yards from the bushes, and as we approached
it&mdash;and while we were still almost concealed&mdash;Lean
suddenly crossed right under the mare's
nose, almost turning her off the course and
throwing her completely out of her stride.
Before she could recover we were upon the
fence. She rose at it, there was a great crash,
and I was thrown forward to her neck, while
she floundered with her nose on the ground.
I heard the sound of a great shout as the crowd
cried, with one voice, "She's down!" The
next moment, however, the plucky little mare
had recovered herself, and we were sailing after
the big brown as fast as bone and muscle could
carry us. Just over the last jump I caught him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
again, and, sending the mare for all she was
worth, just failed by a neck to beat him; that
made us heat and heat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 636px;">
<img src="images/i0004.jpg" width="636" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"SHE FLOUNDERED WITH HER NOSE TO THE GROUND."</p></div>
</div>

<p>I, of course, got a great lecture from my uncle
for trying to catch him after the accident.</p>

<p>"There's another heat, you young duffer," he
said; "why didn't you keep the mare for that?"</p>

<p>"I never thought of it," I told him, truthfully
enough. In my excitement, and being so inexperienced,
my only thought had been to get in
first.</p>

<p>The crowd, however, were loud in their
praises, patting me on the back, shaking my hand,
and loading me with gifts of fruit and sweets.</p>

<p>When we came out for the third and last heat
the sun was near setting, long shadows stretched
over the dry grass, and a cool south-westerly
breeze fanned our faces and blew the scraps of
paper in which luncheons had been wrapped
hither and thither among the crowd.</p>

<p>Barmaid had been well rubbed down and a
couple of buckets of water poured over her, so
that, barring an ugly mark on her stifle where
she had struck, she looked almost as fresh as
paint. She was led up to the humpy and I
weighed out for the last time. Lean was not
yet ready, and while we waited for him a man,
more than half-tipsy, staggered up to the booth,
leading his horse with a rein hung over his arm.
The animal, evidently unused to a crowd,
hung back, and only by dint of much persuasion
was he at last brought close; then his liquor-soaked
owner hooked the rein over the steelyard
on which I had just weighed in and staggered to
the counter for a drink.</p>

<p>The horse, already nervous and fidgety, was
almost frightened to death by the noise of
popping corks, breaking glass, and the mingled
voices of the now noisy crowd. Suddenly,
without warning, he started back, gave one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
two, three desperate tugs at the rein&mdash;and
down came the whole humpy, bringing with it,
of course, those who had been sitting on the
roof to enjoy the last heat of the steeplechase!</p>

<p>The bridle of stout plaited greenhide held,
and after a few wild plunges the horse went
careering madly away over the plain towards the
acacia scrub, the steelyard still dangling from
the rein.</p>

<p>The scene that ensued is entirely beyond me
to describe. Beneath the boughs and rafters
of the fallen humpy&mdash;kicking, cursing, and
shouting&mdash;struggled forty or fifty men, fighting
wildly to release themselves.</p>

<p>"Who the dickens done that?" "Get orf
my 'ed, whoever you are!" "Here, pull us out
o' this, somebody!"&mdash;all sorts of weird cries and
exclamations floated out from the mix-up, until
at last, with many oaths, they emerged one by
one from their captivity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the crowd, whooping excitedly,
were trailing over the plain in the wake of the
flying horse. Talk about "two souls with but
a single thought," here were two hundred in
similar case. Their thought, of course, was the
scales, without which the steeplechase could not
be decided.</p>

<p>There were men riding, men running, men in
carts, men in buggies, men with coats and men
without, all laughing, cursing, and calling, while
off in front went the runaway. Away they all
sailed helter-skelter, some spreading out to the
right and left to head the horse off before he
reached the scrub.</p>

<p>Fortunately for all of us the fugitive's progress
was hampered by the dangling scales, and so he
was ultimately turned back, caught, and led
triumphantly to the scene of the wrecked humpy,
where the scales were hung to the bough of a
tree, Lean weighed, and all was once more ready
for the final.</p>

<p>There was more than a suspicion among the
crowd that Lean had purposely arranged this
little diversion in order that he might go out
without weighing&mdash;an obvious advantage to
him, I having already weighed.</p>

<p>One thing he had succeeded in doing&mdash;delaying
the race until the sun had set and
dusk began to fall, making it almost impossible
to see across the course in the open, much less
in the needle-bush.</p>

<p>There were, of course, only Barmaid and
Pawnbroker to run, and I felt none too comfortable
as Lean pulled his great brown beast
up to my side and looked the mare over. When
the flag fell he went away in the lead, evidently
intending to repeat his crossing trick, but I lay
back a good two lengths behind. After the
second fence he slackened pace to let me creep
up, but I touched the mare smartly with the
whip and shot away in front. I did this so
suddenly that he, holding his horse as he was
at the moment, was some seconds before he
could get going again. Then we both steadied
and took the third jump carefully. Between the
third and last fences was the clump of needle-bush,
extending for about three hundred yards. These
trees, as I said, grow in a loose reddish sand,
and the going there was very heavy, while the
needle-like foliage was so dense that I knew
nothing could be seen of the race from the point
where the people were. As I approached this
point I remembered Brady's words, "Don't
let him be too close to you in the needle-bush."</p>

<p>I felt that I had had enough of it all; a three-mile
steeplechase is no joke for a youngster, and
it was my first race. Lean, I knew, was a very
bad man, and would not hesitate to settle me.
So, determined to get my ordeal over, I plied
my whip, and we literally flew. Pawnbroker,
however, being the stronger horse, gained on me
every stride in the sand, and it was with a gasp
of terror that I presently saw his tan muzzle at
my stirrup. "Barmaid! Barmaid!" I cried, as
with tiring arm I coiled the whalebone round
her flanks, but still that brown head and red,
expanded nostril crept along her side. Then I
felt a hand snatch at my shoulder. Grasping
the rolled blanket on my saddle with one hand,
I turned and lashed fiercely at my opponent's
face.</p>

<p>With a curse of fury he swayed in the saddle
and his horse dropped a little back. Next,
grasping his whip, he aimed a blow at me with
the handle which would have answered his purpose
had it got home, but it fell just too short,
and striking the mare just behind the saddle
simply served to quicken her pace.</p>

<p>He caught me no more. The last fence I
took alone, he coming along steadily some four
or five lengths behind. Fearful and excited,
however, I finished, using the whip as though
running a dead-heat with the Evil One himself.</p>

<p>I told my uncle and Brady what had happened,
of course, but, as they said, it was no use
complaining; it would only be my word against
his. And so the matter ended, Brady rewarding
me for winning the race with a silver watch and
chain.</p>

<p>Lean, under his proper name, afterwards
became a notorious racing swindler, and was
warned off most of the principal courses in
Australia. He ended his days, appropriately
enough, as lessee of one of the lowest "pubs"
in Broken Hill.</p>

<p>A graphic description of a wonderful six-hundred-miles "endurance race" which took place recently
in Wyoming and Colorado, arousing extraordinary public excitement. The photographs accompanying

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Some</span> time ago, while in Denver,
Colorado, Mr. Homer Davenport,
the famous American cartoonist,
made a statement to the effect
that the Arabian steed could travel
farther and quicker than any other breed of
horse extant. To this the owners of the <cite>Denver
Post</cite>, as patriotic Westerners, promptly took
exception. For hard, steady going, day after
day, they said, the native Western "broncho"
could wear the legs off anything that goes on
four feet. This was what the proprietors of the
<cite>Post</cite> believed, and so strongly did they feel it
that they have since expended nine thousand
dollars in instituting an "endurance race," which
should demonstrate once and for ever the
magnificent "staying" qualities of the broncho.</p>

<p><em>From a Photograph.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Prizes were offered ranging in value from a
thousand to fifty dollars, and extraordinary
public interest was at once manifested in the
contest. The whole West woke up, and entries
simply poured in from Colorado, Wyoming,
South Dakota, Utah, and other neighbouring
States. The race was to be over a course five
hundred and ninety-five miles long&mdash;from
Evanston, Wyoming, to Denver, Colorado,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
along the famous old "Overland Trail." The
rules governing the contest were few and simple.
Each competitor was to ride from start to finish
on one horse. He was at liberty to go as he
pleased and keep on as long as he pleased, but
at regular intervals there were to be "checking
stations," where veterinary surgeons would
examine the horses and rule out any animal
which was not in a fit state to proceed. In
this way cruel overtaxing of the horses' strength&mdash;an
unpleasant feature of some of the military
long-distance races on the Continent&mdash;would be
prevented. For the rest the rider could use
his own discretion as to the best way of covering
the six hundred miles of mountain, desert, and
rolling plain that lay between the start and the
winning-post.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE STARTING-POINT OF THE GREAT RACE AT EVANSTON, WYOMING.</p>

<p><em>From a Photograph.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Evanston is situated in the extreme southwestern
part of Wyoming. The course followed
the Union Pacific Railroad across the entire
State to Cheyenne, in the south-east corner,
taking roughly the form of a crescent, and thence
dipped southward to Denver. It was a long,
difficult stretch, for it crossed the "Continental
Divide" of the Rocky Mountains and many a
dry, sandy desert forsaken of man and beast.
On this occasion, however, few of the riders
found it lonesome, for automobiles followed
them in many places, and casual friendly cow
punchers dropped in and rode a few miles here
and there for company with the boys who were
entered to prove the supremacy of the broncho.</p>

<p>From Denver a special train was run to
Evanston, taking with it the horses and riders
of the section, and picking up others <em>en route</em> at
little stations in Wyoming and Colorado. Some
few of the competitors rode into Evanston on
their cow-ponies. Two of these, Workman and
Holman, actually came a distance of four
hundred and fifty miles, at the rate of sixty-five
miles a day, riding the same horses that were
entered for the race! Holman, at least, regretted
this afterward, as he admitted that his steed was
not so fresh for the start as it should have been.</p>

<p>The little town of Evanston was hugely
excited, and made a carnival out of the event.
There was a big "barbecue" the day before the
start, with races, bull-riding, a parade, and
sundry other attractions, and the town was noisy
with the whoops of the gay young fellows who
expected to start out next day on their long,
hard trip "down to Denver."</p>

<p>It was early in the morning when the start
was made. The twenty-five contestants were
lined up and ready for the pistol-shot before six
o'clock. One of the judges made a short speech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
to the riders, cautioning them to ride fair,
remember the rules, and do their level best.
Then he stepped back, the pistol cracked, and
one of the most interesting and important races
ever run in the West was "on."</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE PARADE BEFORE THE START.</p>

<p><em>From a Photograph.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>The only recent long-distance ride worthy of
comparison with this contest was that between
Berlin and Vienna, run between officers of the
Austrian and German armies. The distance
between these two cities is about three hundred
and sixty miles, and it was covered&mdash;over perfectly
level roads&mdash;in seventy-two hours by
Count Stahremburg, an Austrian. Second place
was secured by Lieutenant Reitzenstein, a
German officer, who took about two hours
longer. These horses carried very light weights,
and both of them were put out of commission
for life, one of them falling exhausted at the post
and the other dying next day. It remained to
be seen whether the American broncho could
outlast the thoroughbred steeds of the crack
European cavalry regiments.</p>

<p>The race was run with several objects in view.
One of them was to determine the value of the
native broncho as a cavalry horse for the United
States army; another was to discover how the
bronchos compared with the standard-bred
horses entered in the race. In order to make
the data for comparison as complete as possible
each horse was thoroughly examined and its
markings and measurements noted. The weight
of the entrants was about nine hundred pounds
on the average, though this varied as much as
one hundred and seventy-five pounds each way.
The load they carried was about a hundred
and eighty pounds, including the rider, saddle,
and full equipment.</p>

<p>Charles Workman on Teddy took the lead,
followed closely by Smith. An automobile which
paced the riders for a few miles came back
presently to report that these two were already
opening quite a gap between them and the rest
of the riders. As the day continued the news
indicated that Teddy's long stride was carrying
him farther and farther to the front, Smith
galloping a mile or two behind, with Charlie
Trew on Archie hanging to his flanks. Far
behind these three came the rest of the field,
scattered over many miles of dusty road.</p>

<p>At Carter, the first checking station, Workman
registered at ten-thirty, no other racer
being in sight. He was still alone when he
passed through Church Buttes, though two
other riders were looming up on the distant
skyline. At Granger he was still first in and
out, Teddy clipping the miles off one by one
like a machine. But Smith was coming fast
from the rear, and at Smith's heels still hung
the game little thoroughbred stallion Archie.
It was dark when Workman rode through Bryan,
and by this time Smith had dropped back
beaten, but side by side with Teddy ran Charlie
Trew's Archie. By a great spurt the thoroughbred
passed the broncho Teddy and came in
to Green River first. Here Trew registered,
having ridden one hundred and twelve miles
the first day, and as he turned away Workman
slipped down from the saddle.</p>

<p>"Halloa, Charlie! Beat me in, eh?" he
grinned.</p>

<p>"You bet," came the cheerful answer.</p>

<p>"Your Archie hoss is a great little goer, but
Teddy will wear him down to-morrow," commented
the other man.</p>

<p>"Mebbe he will, and mebbe he won't,"
returned Trew, amiably, as he led his pony to
the stable.</p>

<p>Both riders fed, watered, and rubbed down
their horses before taking any refreshment themselves;
then they lay down in the stalls and
slept beside their animals till they were awakened
before daylight and set off again. Although he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
did not know it, Trew had already won the prize
for the longest single day's travel covered in the
least time.</p>

<p><em>From a Photograph.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>The rest of the twenty-five starters were
scattered along forty miles of road to the rear.
Most of them slept at Granger the first night, and
one or two dropped out of the race at that point,
it being already plain that their horses were
overmatched. Most of the riders, however,
accepted philosophically the fact that Teddy
and Archie had so long a lead.</p>

<p>"It's a long trip to Denver, and I reckon
we'll see them boys again before we drop in
there," they told each other cheerfully.</p>

<p>The leaders reached Rock Springs about
breakfast time. Teddy was still jogging along
easily with long strides, but Archie was already
labouring a little to hold his own. All along
the route were veterinary surgeons to examine
the condition of the horses and put them out of
the race if necessary. Those looking over the
couple now were of opinion that they were
setting too hot a pace to last.</p>

<p>"If I were a betting man I would put my
money on one of those horses back with the
bunch," said one of the examiners confidently.</p>

<p>The next stretch led to Point of Rocks, over
a road which had a good deal of sand. Teddy's
steady trot ploughed right through it, and Archie
had to break into occasional lopes to stay with
the big broncho. After Point of Rocks came
more sand, and still more. The Red Desert tried
the horses, for at every step they sank down into
the loose, thick sand, and Archie began to fall
back, unable to stand the punishment of the
gruelling pace. At Bitter Creek Workman was
riding alone, and he was still alone when he rode
into Wamsutter close on eleven o'clock, having
covered a hundred and ninety-two miles in two
days. Considering the heavy roads, his mount
had done wonders. All over Wyoming people
threw up their hats for the local horse when the
news was flashed over the wires that Teddy led
by a good many miles. But the veterinaries
were still shaking their heads.</p>

<p>"Too fast! Too fast! Teddy will blow up
like the Archie horse," they predicted, sagely.</p>

<p>It was an hour past noon when Charlie
Workman rode into Rawlins next day, fifty miles
nearer the end of his journey. He was followed
a few hours later by "Old Man" Kern, on Dex.
Kern was a man over fifty and the oldest
in the race, but as hardy a pioneer as one would
meet in a long day's journey. He was an ex-cow-puncher,
ex-sheriff, ex-ranchman, and what
he didn't know about horses was not worth
knowing. After Kern came "Wild Jim"
Edwards, a miner, from Diamondville, Wyoming,
followed by Means and McClelland, both of
Colorado. Trew was sixth, and after Trew came
Casto, though some of these did not get in till
next morning. Meanwhile Workman and his
horse were eighteen miles farther on the road, in
spite of the fact that they had been caught in a
driving sleet storm and had lost the way. He
put up for the night at Fort Steele, having made
an average of ninety miles a day, and crossed
the "Continental Divide" of the Rockies into
the bargain. It was agreed on every hand that
the wiry little man from Cody had a remarkable
animal. The horse, however, was irritable, ate
badly, and appeared to be nervous.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the steeds of some of the
riders in the rear were still fresh. Jay Bird,
Sam, Dex, Sorrel Clipper, Cannonball, and
Buck, ridden respectively by Rolla Means,
"Dode" Wykert, Kern, Edwards, Lee, and
Wilcox, all showed up well. A good many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
were looking for Means's thoroughbred, Jay
Bird, to romp home a winner. Others noticed
that Wykert and Lee, though they were fifty
miles behind the pacemaker, came in each night
as fresh as if they had merely been out for an
exercise canter.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>WORKMAN, ON HIS POWERFUL HORSE TEDDY, ARRIVING AT MEDICINE BOW.</p>

<p><em>From a Photograph.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Teddy got as far as Medicine Bow that
night, and he was followed two hours later by
"Old Man" Kern on his big bay, Dex. Means
and Edwards also registered at that station for
the night. By constant hard riding three of his
competitors had caught the leader after four
days' travel, Teddy having let down very considerably
during the day. The rest of the
riders were scattered between that town and
Rawlins, a full day's journey behind. Lee,
Wilcox, and Doling were among those close to
Rawlins; Wykert was not far ahead of them;
and Casto, on Blue Bell, was near the front.</p>

<p>From this point the best of the rear-guard
began to close in on the leaders. Steadily the
four horses of the vanguard&mdash;Teddy, Jay Bird,
Sorrel Clipper, and Dex&mdash;pushed forward over
the rolling hills towards the little city of
Laramie, and just as steadily those behind
jogged forward in their effort to overhaul them.
By nightfall the four were in Laramie. Soon
the horses were groomed, fed, and examined by
the judges. The riders ate their beefsteaks and
lay down beside the ponies. Some time in the
small hours after midnight a solitary, dusty
traveller rode into the town and dismounted
stiffly from his tired horse. The man was
Wykert and the horse Sam. By long night
rides and continual going they had wiped out
the distance between them and the vanguard,
and were now ready to be in at the finish.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>WYKERT LEADING INTO CHEYENNE.</p>

<p><em>From a Photograph.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>When the riders moved out of Laramie toward
Cheyenne the next morning, there were five of
them instead of four. Wykert, with a grin,
nodded greeting to his fellows.</p>

<p>"Mornin', boys."</p>

<p>"Mornin'. Where did you drop from?"
asked Kern, nonchalantly.</p>

<p>"Me? Oh, I just happened along to be in
at the finish."</p>

<p>"I'll tell them you're coming," laughed
Means.</p>

<p>Wykert eyed the horse, Jay Bird, carefully.</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon you'll have to 'phone the
news to Denver, then," he returned, casually.</p>

<p>For Jay Bird, game thoroughbred though he
was, showed the effects of travel very plainly,
and though Means might still jest about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
result he was already beginning to suspect that
the native bronchos against which he was pitted
would wear him down before the remaining one
hundred and seventy-five miles of the race were
covered.</p>

<p>At Granite Canyon "Old Man" Kern and his
Dex were in the lead, with Teddy second, but
the five horses kept well bunched, and it was
Wykert who rode first into Cheyenne, the capital
of Wyoming, that afternoon. Eight minutes
later Edwards and Workman rode in together.
Means and the thoroughbred were fourth, and
the "Old Man" last.</p>

WYKERT AND WORKMAN FINISHED IN A DEAD-HEAT, THE EXCITEMENT OF THE CROWD WAS INDESCRIBABLE.</p>

<p><em>From a Photograph.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Cheyenne gave the riders a great reception.
The Governor of the State, a former governor,
and a retired army general were among those
who went out in automobiles to escort the boys
into the city. Everybody cheered for one or
another of the horses, and though the Wyoming
ones were naturally the favourites the Colorado
horses got a good round of applause as well.</p>

<p>It had been the intention of the riders to get
a few hours' much-needed sleep at Cheyenne,
but they had scarcely lain down in their stalls
beside the ponies before word came to the
others that Workman had slipped out and was
on the road to Denver.</p>

<p>Tired as they were, the others were on their
feet in an instant, slapping on their saddles and
making ready to follow. It came cruelly hard
on both mounts and riders, for all of them
certainly deserved a good rest. Instead, they
faced a long ride through the night, plodding
on hour after hour in the darkness, persevering
doggedly in spite of fatigue and the
craving for sleep. They could not "quit" so
long as it was in their horses to keep on going.</p>

<p>They were now on the final lap, the last
hundred miles. The pace was hot, for each
was hoping to wear out the others. Mile after
mile they galloped through the night, the
<cite>Denver Post</cite> automobile at their heels. At
Carr the rest of the five caught up with
Workman and Teddy. After half an hour's
rest here two new pacemakers swung out to
show the tired riders the road to Greeley. It
was a "Texas jog" at first, then it quickened
to a trot and grew faster, until Dex could no
longer keep the pace. "Old Man" Kern drew
to one side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's too fast for me," he said, and let the
motor-car pass him.</p>

<p>Jim Edwards was the next to fall back, and
after him Rolla Means. Workman on Teddy
and Wykert on Sam were left to fight it out
alone.</p>

</div>

<p>Three times the big Wyoming horse pulled
out in front, but "Dode" Wykert's roan hung
steadily to his heels. Greeley was left behind,
and then Fort Lupton, first one horse and then
the other being ahead. At Brighton they were
even, Sam being plainly in the better condition of
the two, but unable to get ahead of Teddy. At
last the outskirts of Denver showed in the distance.
Automobiles and horsemen by hundreds
had come out to escort them in. Still the two
horses were neck and neck, and down in the
heart of the city, where they passed between
two living walls of excited humanity, they were
still abreast. And so, under the finishing wire,
in front of the
offices of the
<cite>Denver Post</cite>,
the two plucky
ponies made
their last spurt
in the great six-hundred-mile
race with not an
inch to choose
between them.
It had been a
dead heat!</p>

<p>The first and
second prizes
were divided
between the two
men, but the
"condition
prize" of three
hundred dollars
was awarded to
Wykert's Sam
by a unanimous
decision of the
judges, for there was not the least doubt that
Sam was comparatively fresh, while Teddy was
very, very tired indeed.</p>

<p>Sorrel Clipper, with Edwards up, finished
third some five hours later, and received the two
hundred dollars prize. Kern came in shortly
after, and six hours after him Casto, on Blue Bell,
crossed the line. It was nearly twelve hours
after this that Lee, on Cannonball, ambled
leisurely down Champa Street and claimed the
sixth and last prize.</p>

<p>It was a great race, pluckily run, and every
horse that came in for prize-money was of the
broncho breed. Rolla Means's Jay Bird, which
had made so strong a bid for the first place, had
given out entirely about Greeley, some sixty
miles from the finish. This was the last of the
standard-bred horses to stay with the leaders.
For speed, wind, and "bottom" the bronchos
had come through the test splendidly.</p>

<p>It was a great
triumph for the
game little
broncho. Not
pretty to look
at, he is the best
in the world for
the conditions
which prevail
on the plains
and in the
Rockies. For
other surroundings,
perhaps,
other types of
horse are best,
but for rough-and-ready
going
in all kinds of
weather, with
no feed except
what it can pick
up, the broncho
asks odds of
none.</p>

<p>The amazing experience which befell a drunken old Russian bootmaker. "The events described
occurred within my own cognizance while living in St. Petersburg," writes the author. "The
episode could only have happened in Russia, unless there is any other country where the military
caste is held in such veneration among civilians."</p></div>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i0013dc.jpg" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> was the birthday of Petroff, the
bootmaker, and he had been celebrating
it in the customary manner.
That is to say, he had consumed
so much of his favourite beverage,
vodka, that he had now become hopelessly and
helplessly intoxicated. In fact, so drunk was
Petroff that the proprietor of the St. Petersburg
inn where he had been soaking steadily all the
afternoon had just turned him out into the
street on the sufficient grounds that he could
neither drink nor purchase any more liquor.</p>

<p>As poor Petroff staggered from the inhospitable
doors of the inn, accompanied by the
jeers of the remaining patrons, he fell into the
arms of a couple of stalwart policemen.</p>

<p>"Lemme go," he protested, as the detaining
hands tightened on his wrists. "I tell you I'm
not&mdash;hic&mdash;drunk! I'm all ri'&mdash;shober as a
judge, in fact. I want to go home."</p>

<p>The policemen laughed callously.</p>

<p>"You're going to the station with us,"
remarked the senior, with a grin at his comrade.
"A night in the cells will cool your
head, old man. Now, then, come along. Go
quietly, or it will be the worse for you."</p>

<p>Petroff's legs swayed, and he would have
fallen had not his escort, who were accustomed
to dealing with such cases, held him tightly in
their grasp.</p>

<p>The spectacle of the tipsy old man being
led through the streets in custody promptly
attracted a crowd, who followed the little procession
at a respectful distance. Petroff turned
his bleary eyes upon them, in the vain hope that
they might light upon someone who would
soften the hearts of his captors. Then another
thought struck him with a chill feeling of dismay.
If&mdash;as seemed certain to be his fate&mdash;he
were locked up all night his wife would demand
an explanation the next time he saw her.
Mme. Petroff was a bit of a virago, and the
drunken old reprobate had a wholesome terror
of what might be in store for him if she got
wind of his misbehaviour.</p>

<p>"Lemme go home," he whimpered. "I've a
mosh important engagement&mdash;hic! My wife is
waiting for me. It's all ri', I tell you."</p>

<p>The crowd laughed uproariously, as though
they had just heard an excellent joke, while the
policemen gave their prisoner a push forward.</p>

<p>Petroff wept bitterly. He was just going
to burst into an angry denunciation upon their
conduct, when his attention was attracted by a
couple of officers in military uniform, who strode
up to him with outstretched hands.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," exclaimed the younger of
the two, looking at him in a puzzled fashion,
"what on earth is the meaning of all this? It
won't do, you know. We must take care of you."</p>

<p>Petroff's eyes began to blink, and he pinched
himself to make certain he was not dreaming.
But no; everything was quite real. Here were
two of the Czar's officers, whom he had no
recollection of ever having seen before, actually
claiming his acquaintance! Wonders would
never cease! It was no time, however, for argument.
Evidently the strangers meant him well,
and if they were making a mistake he meant to
profit by it. Shaking the speaker's hand, accordingly,
he poured out his wrongs in an eager
torrent.</p>

<p>The brilliant uniforms of the two new-comers
had a magic effect upon Petroff's custodians.</p>

<p>"I beg your Excellency's pardon," said one
of them, with a deferential salute, "but we found
this&mdash;er&mdash;gentleman drunk in the streets, and
we thought it best to take him to the station.
May I inquire if you know him?"</p>

<p>The officer nodded.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he returned. "We know him
very well indeed. In fact, he's a neighbour of
ours. I'm afraid he's had too much to drink.
We'll take charge of him, though, and see
him safely home. Here's something for your
trouble," he added, slipping a couple of roubles
into the other's hand.</p>

<p>"Please call a cab, and we'll take the
professor to his rooms," observed the second
officer, who had not yet spoken.</p>

<p>Petroff smiled affably. It was much pleasanter
to be called a professor than a drunken old
man.</p>

<p>"It's all ri'," he exclaimed, delightedly.
"These gentlemen are&mdash;hic&mdash;old friends of
mine. We'll all go home together&mdash;see?"</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"'MY DEAR FELLOW', EXCLAIMED THE YOUNGER OF THE TWO, 'WHAT ON EARTH IS THE MEANING OF ALL THIS?'"</p></div>
</div>

<p>The two policemen, their last doubts dissipated
by the promptitude with which the
officers claimed their charge's acquaintance,
acquiesced readily enough. A cab was procured
and Petroff and his new-found friends
installed therein, while the coachman was
directed to drive to an address in a fashionable
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>As the vehicle started off, Petroff looked at
his deliverers with fresh wonder.</p>

<p>"Where have I met you before?" he
murmured. "I don't seem to remember. Did
you ever come to my boot-shop? If so, I mush
have been drunk!"</p>

<p>The officer thus addressed shook his head
gravely. "We had the honour of meeting
your Excellency when you served in the
army."</p>

<p>Petroff looked more puzzled than ever.</p>

<p>"The army?" he repeated. "What do
you mean? I'm not a soldier. I'm a bootmaker."</p>

<p>The two officers exchanged glances.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon for venturing to contradict
you, sir, but the Czar has just been pleased
to promote you to major-general in appreciation
of your distinguished services."</p>

<p>Petroff smiled happily.</p>

<p>"It's the first I've heard of it," he murmured.</p>

<p>"I fancied, sir, that you might have been
celebrating the appointment already," was the
grave response. "We shall, however, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
honoured if you will join us in a little refreshment.
Our house is close at hand."</p>

<p>"Certainly, my friends. I was going to have
a drink when those rude policemen interfered
just now."</p>

<p>As the old man spoke the cab drew up at the
door of a handsome building. The next
moment Petroff found himself being ushered
into a beautifully-furnished room. Here the
first thing upon which his eyes fell was a sideboard
covered with bottles and glasses.</p>

<p>"How perfectly lovely!" he exclaimed, clasping
his hands in ecstasy. "You don't know
how thirsty I am. But what house is this?"</p>

<p>"It is your house, general."</p>

<p>The bootmaker's eyes blinked.</p>

<p>"Who's a general?" he demanded, truculently.
"I won't have you make fun of me."</p>

<p>The senior of the two officers bowed
deferentially.</p>

<p>"Your Excellency is pleased to jest. Of
course you are a general. As, however, it is
only to-day that you were appointed one, it is
quite possible that the fact has escaped your
memory."</p>

<p>Petroff's momentary anger evaporated at the
speaker's apologetic tone. After all, it was
much better to be a major-general than a bootmaker,
and he was not going to quarrel with his
good fortune.</p>

<p>"I did forget it for the moment," he returned,
"but I'll remember it now. If I'm a major-general,
though, I must have something to
drink, eh?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, your Excellency," replied the
other, as he uncorked a bottle of vodka and
poured out a brimming glass. Petroff sat sipping
it happily, when the second officer came over to
his chair and saluted.</p>

<p>"Will your Excellency be pleased to dress
now?" he remarked. "It is time to get into
uniform." Then, without waiting for the old
man to recover from the surprise which this
announcement created, he brought forward a
richly ornamented tunic, together with the
remaining items of a general's uniform. Petroff
gazed at the clothes in awe; he had never seen
so much magnificence in his life.</p>

<p>As his two companions proceeded to make
his toilet for him he could do nothing but
murmur, "I'm a general." At last he had
repeated the statement so often that, in his
befuddled condition, he almost came to believe
in it.</p>

<p>"I suppose I am <em>really</em> a general?" he
remarked, as his companions assisted him to
buckle on his sword.</p>

<p>"There is no doubt of it, your Excellency,"
replied the senior. "Let me introduce myself
as Major Romanoff, and my colleague here as
Captain Marckovitch. We have been appointed
to act as your adjutants, and shall be pleased to
carry out any orders you may give us."</p>

<p>Petroff laughed delightedly. This was a
thousand times better than being a bootmaker
and getting locked up for taking too much
vodka.</p>

<p>"Very well, then; if I'm a general I must
have another drink," he declared, stretching out
his hand towards the table.</p>

<p>The fiery spirit seemed to touch a chord of
memory.</p>

<p>"But what about my wife?" he demanded,
suddenly. "Does she know I'm a&mdash;hic&mdash;general?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir. In fact, she has been trying
to find you all day."</p>

<p>Petroff's face paled.</p>

<p>"What does she want?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Merely to offer your Excellency her congratulations."</p>

<p>Here was a new mystery.</p>

<p>"That's very strange. She never wanted to&mdash;hic&mdash;congratulate
me before."</p>

<p>"But she has only just heard of your promotion,
sir."</p>

<p>The look of dismay faded from the old man's
countenance, and a placid smile took its place.</p>

<p>"I must buy her a present," he declared.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. That is why we are going out.
Your wife will have to be presented at His
Majesty's next reception, and you must accordingly
order her some suitable jewels.
Captain Marckovitch and I will be very pleased
to conduct you to a firm where you can obtain
such diamonds and other articles as will be
necessary."</p>

<p>Petroff gulped down another glass of vodka.
Under its stimulus his mind was working
rapidly.</p>

<p>"That's all very well, my friends, but how
am I going to get the money to pay for them?
I spent my last rouble in the inn where the
policemen found me."</p>

<p>Major Romanoff nodded.</p>

<p>"We have not yet had time to draw any funds
from the Treasury on your behalf. Everything
will be all right by to-morrow, though. In the
meantime my colleague and myself will see that
you are supplied with whatever you may be
pleased to order at any shop. As the afternoon
is drawing in, I would propose that we set out
for a drive at once in your carriage."</p>

<p>Petroff rubbed his eyes in amazement. It
seemed that surprises would never cease.</p>

<p>"But I haven't got a carriage," he protested.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said Captain Marckovitch,
"but your Excellency's establishment includes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
a carriage and pair. It is already waiting at the
door. Will it please you to make a start just
now?"</p>

<p>"All right! I suppose I can't say anything
better than that, can I?"</p>

<p>Captain Marckovitch bowed.</p>

<p>"Certainly, that will do admirably. In fact,
sir, it's the only thing you need say while you
are with us. Perhaps you will graciously pardon
me if I take this opportunity of once more
reminding you that, as your appointment is so&mdash;er&mdash;recent,
it would perhaps be best if you
permitted yourself to be guided by Major
Romanoff and myself."</p>

<p>Petroff wagged his grey head with an air of
profound wisdom. "Quite so. You tell me
what to say, and I'll say it."</p>

<p>The senior adjutant bowed gravely.</p>

<p>"I was going to suggest that, sir. We are
now all going out together to make some purchases
for your Excellency's wife. While we
are in the different shops it will not be necessary
for you to say anything but 'All right' whenever
your opinion is asked. You see, sir, your previous
experience has almost entirely been gained
on the field of battle. In fact, you have only
just returned from a campaign."</p>

<p>"Have I?" interrupted the old man. "'Pon
my word, I don't recollect it very clearly."</p>

<p>"Your Excellency was wounded in action,"
observed Captain Marckovitch, suavely. "Your
memory may not return for a day or two. Still,
you have only to say 'All right.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, I can remember that."</p>

<p>There was only time for a parting glass of
vodka, and as Petroff drained the last drop in
the bottle all his qualms disappeared. He felt
determined to show the whole of St. Petersburg
that he was as fine a major-general as any that
the army of the Czar contained. The whole
way down the stairs and out into the courtyard
he kept repeating to himself, "I'm a general.
All right."</p>

<p>A splendidly-appointed carriage was in waiting
at the doorway. As the trio entered it, Major
Romanoff gave the liveried coachman the address
of a jewellery establishment in the Nevski
Prospect. A few minutes' drive brought them
to the door. The moment they alighted the
manager and his assistants, dazzled by the
magnificent equipage and uniforms of the party,
came forward to receive their illustrious patrons
with deferential bows.</p>

<p>Major Romanoff went up to Petroff, who
had sunk heavily into a chair.</p>

<p>"Shall I explain your Excellency's wishes to
Mr. Gorshine?" he inquired.</p>

<p>The manager rubbed his hands briskly.
The unknown patron was an Excellency, then!</p>

<p>"All right," said Petroff.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I might be permitted to show his
Excellency a selection from my stock," suggested
Mr. Gorshine.</p>

<p>"Quite so," said Captain Marckovitch, hastily.
"You must, however, please understand that
his Excellency does not wish to spend more
than two hundred thousand roubles this afternoon.
The general," he added, sinking his
voice a little, "is not feeling very well, so
perhaps you had better make all the arrangements
with Major Romanoff and myself."</p>

<p>Mr. Gorshine nodded comprehendingly.</p>

<p>"I understand perfectly, sir. His Excellency
shall not be inconvenienced at all. Now, what
can I have the pleasure of showing you?"</p>

<p>"His Excellency wishes to buy a diamond
tiara and other jewellery for his wife. He
would also like some rings and bracelets.
Show us the best that your stock contains."</p>

<p>The manager beamed with delight, and, hastily
unlocking a large safe, produced tray after tray
covered with beautiful gems. The two adjutants
inspected their contents hastily, and put aside
the finest for a more detailed examination.</p>

<p>"How will this suit?" inquired Captain
Marckovitch, picking up a magnificent tiara.</p>

<p>Petroff, who was feeling drowsy after his
plentiful consumption of vodka, pushed it away
with a lordly gesture.</p>

<p>"All right," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Then his Excellency approves of it?"
inquired the delighted manager.</p>

<p>"Certainly, Mr. Gorshine; you have just
heard him say so," declared Major Romanoff.
"Pack it up."</p>

<p>"I'm feeling very thirsty," murmured Petroff.
"Why doesn't somebody give me a drink?"</p>

<p>The obsequious jeweller rushed forward.</p>

<p>"Pray allow me to send for refreshments," he
begged.</p>

<p>Captain Marckovitch nodded meaningly
towards the chair where Petroff was sitting.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I ought to have told you that the
general has a little weakness," he said. "His
Excellency has only lately returned from a hot
climate, and&mdash;well&mdash;you understand, no doubt."</p>

<p>The jeweller bowed.</p>

<p>"Entirely so, sir," he whispered. "In fact,
a brother of mine, who is also in the army,
cannot stand the slightest&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Besides," interrupted the adjutant, "we
must make every allowance for so distinguished
an officer. Apart from his bravery in action, it
is well known that his kindness of heart, his
thoughtfulness, and his generosity are proverbial.
All the presents that he is buying now are
intended for his wife."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm going to give them to my wife,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
said Petroff, sharply. "She'll be so pleased
that she'll forgive me. Now bring out some
more. It's all right."</p>

<p>Mr. Gorshine wanted nothing better. Here
was a customer who showed a lordly indifference
to price, and who approved of everything set
before him. Clearly a profitable afternoon was
in store. Accordingly, he exerted himself to
ransack the shelves and show-cases of their
finest gems. These, after being critically inspected
by the two adjutants, were passed over
to their companion, who, for his part, contented
himself with drowsily murmuring "All right."</p>

<p>At last, when goods to the estimated value of
two hundred thousand roubles had been set
aside, Major Romanoff declared that enough
had been exhibited.</p>

<p>Mr. Gorshine bowed again. He had done a
very fine day's work and nothing was to be
gained by being too greedy.</p>

<p>"Might I venture to inquire his Excellency's
name?" he hazarded.</p>

<p>Captain Marckovitch looked at him haughtily.</p>

<p>"I am surprised that you do not recognise
the general," he remarked. "This is his
Highness the Prince Savanoff, who has just
returned from special service in the Caucasus.
He is at present occupying an appointment at
the Imperial Court."</p>

<p>"That's all right," murmured Petroff.</p>

<p>The jeweller was almost overcome with confusion
at the slip he had made. Not to be
familiar with the name of Prince Savanoff&mdash;the
illustrious soldier whom all Russia was honouring
just then on account of his distinguished
services in the Caucasus&mdash;indicated a quite
abysmal ignorance.</p>

<p>"Of course, I recognise his Excellency's
name," he protested, humbly. "I had not,
however, seen a photograph of the Prince."</p>

<p>Major Romanoff bent his brows.</p>

<p>"The Prince is as modest as he is brave. On
this account he has never permitted his portrait
to appear in the papers."</p>

<p>"Ten thousand apologies," exclaimed the
contrite Mr. Gorshine. "And now, sir, is there
anything else I can have the honour of showing
you?"</p>

<p>"I will inquire," said the other, as he shook
Petroff by the shoulder. "Is your Highness
satisfied with what you have already chosen? If
so, perhaps I had better take the jewels to the
palace and let her Highness, your wife, decide
which she will retain. Then, when I return,
you can pay Mr. Gorshine for what she wishes
to keep."</p>

<p>"All right," muttered Petroff.</p>

<p>The adjutant turned to the smiling jeweller.</p>

<p>"Very well, then. As time presses, I will
start at once. His Excellency and Captain
Marckovitch will remain here to await my return.
The carriage is outside, and I can get to the
palace and back in less than half an hour.
Please pack everything up very carefully."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir. If her Highness would like
me to change any of these ornaments for others
I shall be only too pleased to do so. Might I
also beg, sir, that you will use your influence
with the Prince to secure me an appointment
as jeweller to the Court? Perhaps his Excellency
would sign my application now?"</p>

<p>The major shrugged his shoulders and
glanced at the somnolent Petroff.</p>

<p>"I'm really afraid," he answered, in a low
tone, "that his Highness is scarcely in a condition
to sign anything at this moment. Still, I
will remember the matter. I should prefer,
however, to speak to the Princess about it first.
After all, these jewels are for her, you know."</p>

<p>"Quite so," was the prompt reply. "I will
not detain you any longer."</p>

<p>As he spoke the manager picked up the
velvet-lined cases and followed the adjutant to
the carriage. When it disappeared from sight
he went back into the shop, full of delight at
the excellent stroke of business he had accomplished.</p>

<p>"A charming afternoon, your Excellency," he
remarked.</p>

<p>Petroff gave vent to a long-drawn-out snore
and dropped his head on the counter.</p>

<p>"The Prince is a little fatigued," observed
Captain Marckovitch, apologetically. "He is
not used to buying jewels. Perhaps you will be
good enough to make out your bill, and it can
be settled when my brother adjutant returns
with her Excellency's decision."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir. I will see about it at once."</p>

<p>Withdrawing to the counting-house, Mr.
Gorshine spent a pleasant quarter of an hour
totalling up the cost of the various articles which
had been selected on approval. A smile of
content spread over his features as he saw the
substantial amount to which it came. Even if
Major Romanoff brought back half the goods
there would still be a handsome profit on the
transaction. Certainly, Prince Savanoff was the
sort of customer he would like to see in his shop
every day in the week.</p>

<p>Presently he returned and handed the itemized
account to the adjutant. Captain Marckovitch
cast a cursory glance over it, and then put it
down with a careless gesture.</p>

<p>"I expected it to be a good deal larger," he
said, airily.</p>

<p>Mr. Gorshine began to reproach himself for
not having added twenty-five per cent. to every
item. The Prince would have paid it, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
felt sure. However, it was no good wasting
time on vain regrets. Accordingly, he began to
speculate what would be the best position in
his showroom for displaying the coveted certificate
appointing him Court jeweller. A quarter
of an hour passed in this fashion. Mr. Gorshine
looked at the clock pointedly. The evening
was coming on, and it would soon be time to
close the premises for the night.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i0018.jpg" width="700" height="551" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"'THE PRINCE IS A LITTLE FATIGUED,' OBSERVED CAPTAIN MARCKOVITCH."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Major Romanoff is longer than I expected,"
observed Captain Marckovitch, taking out his
watch.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he has not found her Excellency at
home," suggested the other.</p>

<p>"I dare say you're right. It is quite possible,
too, that her Excellency was out shopping when
the major reached the palace. In this case he
will naturally have decided to wait until she
returns."</p>

<p>"Oh, naturally," agreed the jeweller.</p>

<p>Another twenty minutes went by. Despite
all his efforts to appear at ease Mr. Gorshine
began to feel a little disturbed. Several possible
explanations of the delay occurred to him, the
most likely one being that the Princess might
have decided to see the general before making
up her mind.</p>

<p>The adjutant interrupted his train of thought.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's not very far off your usual
closing time," he remarked.</p>

<p>"We generally close at seven, sir."</p>

<p>The captain glanced at his watch again.</p>

<p>"It is now half-past six. If I start at once I
can get to the palace and back by seven.
Would you like me to drive there and explain
that his Highness the Prince wishes her Excellency
to make an immediate decision? Then,
if by any chance I find she has not arrived,
I will come back with Major Romanoff and
the jewels."</p>

<p>Mr. Gorshine felt almost overwhelmed at such
condescension.</p>

<p>"I could not think of troubling you, sir," he
protested. "I will send one of my assistants."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that won't do," returned the
other, with a laugh. "You see, only an officer
of the Guards would be admitted to the palace
at this hour, and as I feel that I ought to relieve
your very natural anxiety I will go myself. By
the way, on no account disturb his Excellency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
during my absence. It would make him very
angry, and he might cancel his order."</p>

<p>"Certainly not, sir."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, I'll start at once. Be good
enough to call a cab with a fast horse."</p>

<p>Secretly overjoyed at having the matter thus
settled, but volubly protesting his disinclination
to trouble his illustrious patron, the jeweller
escorted the captain to the door and saw him
into a cab. Then he returned to the showroom,
where a group of assistants, with smiling
faces, were watching the still snoring Petroff.
As the manager came up to his chair he opened
his eyes sleepily.</p>

<p>"It's all right," he murmured.</p>

<p>Darkness began to fall. It was too late to
expect any more customers. In fact, the usual
closing hour had already gone by and the
assistants were beginning to get restless. Mr.
Gorshine went to the doorway a dozen times
and peered out into the street. On each
occasion, however, he returned to his desk in
disappointment. There was no sign of either
Major Romanoff or Captain Marckovitch.</p>

<p>"What can have happened to his Excellency's
adjutants?" he said. "They ought to have
been back here long ago."</p>

<p>The principal assistant blew his nose thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"It's a long way after closing time, sir. I
really think we ought to awaken his Excellency."</p>

<p>Mr. Gorshine, mindful of Captain Marckovitch's
injunction, would not hear of such a thing.</p>

<p>"On no account," he exclaimed. "If we
did so, his Highness would be certain to cancel
the order he has given us."</p>

<p>At the end of another half-hour, however, the
jeweller decided that it would perhaps be better
to take his assistant's advice after all. There
was just a possibility, too, that the Prince might
catch cold. Besides, he ought to be back in
the palace by this time for dinner. Accordingly
he went up to him deferentially and laid a
respectful hand upon his epauletted shoulder.</p>

<p>"I beg your Excellency's pardon," he said,
"but your adjutants have not yet returned,
and we wish to close the establishment now.
If you will graciously permit me, I will see
you back to the palace."</p>

<p>"All right," muttered Petroff. "I'm a general."</p>

<p>"Certainly, your Highness; but this is closing
time."</p>

<p>The vodka mounted to Petroff's brain, and
he began to get angry.</p>

<p>"Go to the devil!" he shouted, rising unsteadily
to his feet. "I'm a general, I tell
you. I want a drink. If you don't let me
have one I'll put you all in prison!"</p>

<p>"Oh, pray forgive me!" exclaimed the
manager, regretting his boldness. "I did not
mean to inconvenience your Excellency. I
merely wished to point out that it is closing
time, and that perhaps you would like to return
home."</p>

<p>A gleam of intelligence crept into Petroff's
eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, I want to go home," he murmured.
"I want to see my wife."</p>

<p>"Then pray permit me to escort you. I will
send for a carriage at once."</p>

<p>"All right," was the sulky response.</p>

<p>Although the keen night air sweeping up
the open street sobered him a little, Petroff
was still somewhat unsteady on his feet. Mr.
Gorshine and a couple of assistants, however,
managed to get him into a cab.</p>

<p>"Will your Highness have the goodness to
give me the address to which you wish to be
driven?" inquired the manager, deferentially,
as he took the opposite seat.</p>

<p>With some little difficulty Petroff remembered
the obscure quarter of the city in which he
lived, and repeated the name and number of
the street. Mr. Gorshine heard the answer in
amazement, convinced that there must be some
mistake. His companion, however, showed
such an inclination to become argumentative
that he finally decided to humour him, and they
set off for the address indicated.</p>

<p>At the end of half an hour's drive the cab
stopped in front of a squalid-looking house in
a mean little side-street, far removed from the
fashionable quarter of the city.</p>

<p>"It's all right," declared Petroff, glancing out
of the window. "Here we are. Don't let my
wife get angry with me. Tell her it wasn't my
fault."</p>

<p>The jeweller smiled reassuringly, as the other
clung to his arm and led the way up a steep
flight of stairs. At the top floor Petroff stopped
and fumbled with his latch-key.</p>

<p>"Don't wake my wife," he whispered.</p>

<p>As he spoke, however, the door was flung
suddenly open, and an elderly woman, brandishing
a stick, rushed out into the passage.</p>

<p>"There you are, then, you wicked old
drunkard!" she exclaimed, shrilly. "I'll give
you something for stopping out all this time.
See if I don't!"</p>

<p>"Please don't let her hit me," shrieked
Petroff, trying to hide behind his companion.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, madam, but his Highness is
unwell," protested the jeweller, quite at a loss to
account for this extraordinary reception.</p>

<p>Mme. Petroff burst into a peal of derisive
laughter.</p>

<p>"Unwell, is he?" she retorted. "He'll be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
worse presently, I can promise you!" Then
her eyes fell on the magnificent uniform her
husband was wearing.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"'PLEASE DON'T LET HER HIT ME,' SHRIEKED PETROFF, TRYING TO HIDE BEHIND HIS COMPANION."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"What drunken freak is this?" she cried.
"How dare you dress up as an officer, you silly
old guy?"</p>

<p>Mr. Gorshine's face grew suddenly pale.</p>

<p>"I beg you not to be angry with his Highness,"
he exclaimed. "His adjutants, Major
Romanoff and Captain Marckovitch, will probably
be here directly."</p>

<p>Mme. Petroff snorted indignantly.</p>

<p>"I believe you're drunk, too. Since when,
pray, has my husband been a Highness? He
was Petroff, the bootmaker, this morning."</p>

<p>Mr. Gorshine sank into a chair, overwhelmed
with horror.</p>

<p>"What?" he gasped, as soon as he found his
breath. "Is not this his Highness Prince
Savanoff, the famous general?"</p>

<p>"The famous fiddlestick," returned the other.
"He's no more a Highness, and a Prince, and a
general than you are yourself. He's a rascally,
drunken old bootmaker, who disgraces the name
of Petroff."</p>

<p>With the angry woman's shrill laughter ringing
in his ears the unhappy jeweller staggered
from the room and rushed down the stairs. He
could think of nothing but the loss he had just
sustained. By reporting the matter to the police
at once there was a bare chance that some of
the property might yet be recovered.</p>

<p>The superintendent of police, however, to
whom he poured out his story, could not offer
him much encouragement. It was clear that
he had been made the victim of a singularly
audacious robbery. The only thing that the
authorities could do was to arrest Petroff as an
accomplice. As, however, there was no evidence
to connect him with the theft, he was, after a
week's enforced sobriety, permitted to return to
his wife.</p>

<p>This was comforting for Petroff, perhaps, but
it was anything but pleasant for the hapless
Mr. Gorshine, who never saw his jewels or the
two "adjutants" again.</p>

<p>Some of the customs in vogue at American Universities are startling enough, but it comes as a
surprise to learn that the authorities of an ancient Scottish foundation, aided and abetted by the
police, countenance such extraordinary doings as are chronicled in this topical article. The writer
describes the Glasgow University Rectorial Election of 1905, in which he took part as an official of
one of the clubs concerned.</p></div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i0021dc.jpg" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">On</span> October 24th of this year the
students of Glasgow University will
choose for themselves a new Lord
Rector. Already announcements
have appeared in the Press that the
candidates are Lord Curzon (Conservative), Mr.
Lloyd George (Liberal), and Mr. Keir Hardie
(Socialist).</p>

<p>Triennially the public reads in some obscure
corner in its newspapers that a Rectorial election
is in progress in a Scotch University, that the
fighting is fiercer than ever before, and that
damage has been done amounting to hundreds
of pounds. The reader, according to his viewpoint,
either swiftly ejaculates a condemnation
of such barbarous practices or grins as he
detects what he takes to be newspaper exaggerations.
The real facts behind all this
the general public never learn; they never
realize what a strange anachronism a Rectorial
election is.</p>

<p>Fancy carefully-organized fighting, with a
hundred or two hundred young men on either
side, ending in the wrecking of the premises of
the losers&mdash;to the breaking down the plaster of
the walls and the tearing up of the floor&mdash;all
countenanced by staid University authorities and
countenanced, too, by the police department of
a municipality that prides itself on being the
most up-to-date in the country! Indeed, the
police not only countenance the business but
actually assist by sending forces of men to the
scene of operations to ring round the arena,
keep back the crowd, and often to hold up the
electric cars and other street traffic while the
rival parties push the claims of their respective
candidates <i lang="la">vi et armis</i>! In the exigencies of
the campaign, moreover, many deeds are done
with perfect impunity by the students which
would be seriously visited on less favoured
mortals&mdash;for example, the cutting through of
main water-pipes, carrying the supplies of whole
blocks of buildings.</p>

<p>The good people of Glasgow are, for the most
part, not at all inclined to withdraw this licence.
They are, on the contrary, rather proud of the
sacrifices they make in order that old customs
may be kept up, and their complacency and
good-humoured tolerance are almost inconceivable
to people of non-University towns.</p>

<p>That the readers of <span class="smcap">The Wide World
Magazine</span> may realize what lies behind the
fragmentary reports which they will find in their
newspapers this month I shall relate what I
know of Glasgow Rectorial elections, and particularly
of the last election in November, 1905,
in which I was specially concerned.</p>

<p>In most other Universities in these days the
Rectorship is a purely academic distinction, probably
conferred unanimously by the students.
In Glasgow, however, it is still decided on
political grounds.</p>

<p>In the University there exist two permanent
clubs: the Glasgow University Conservative
Club and the Glasgow University Liberal Club,
the constitutional purpose of each of which is to
effect the election of a Lord Rector of its own
political colour.</p>

<p>For three years&mdash;since the last election&mdash;these
clubs have been scraping money together. The
election will cost each side from two to four
hundred pounds, and the size of the fight they
put up and their output of election literature
will be on the scale of the funds in hand.
Needless to say, most of the money comes from
party sources and private subscriptions outside
the University, but owing to the extraordinary
nature of the campaign no accounts are ever
made public. Like Tammany Hall and other
efficient political "machines," a despotism is
absolutely necessary. The entire control of the
money is vested in four, or three, or even two
students, and no questions are ever asked as to
the uses to which they think best to put it.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the session preceding the
election the presidents of the clubs, with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
secrecy, approach various leading men of their
parties, and finally fix on candidates. In the
second half of the session, about February, the
candidates are announced, and soon afterwards
the Conservative and Liberal Rectorial Committees
are formed. These committees are
large, numbering, perhaps, fifty in each, though,
as I have said, the actual executives are very
small. Each committee is divided into three
sections&mdash;the canvassing, the literature, and the
physical force.</p>

<p>The conveners of these sub-committees are
busy all through the summer vacation with
preparations for the coming fray, forming their
plans, inventing ruses, and intriguing for various
advantages.</p>

<p>The campaign commences in earnest as soon
as college reassembles in the third week of
October, and continues in a wild whirl of excitement
for a fortnight, until the day of election.
Then all the leading men, haggard and nearly
dead with fatigue and the incessant strain, go to
bed and sleep for twenty-four hours. The day
after the election the 'Varsity is as quiet and
peaceful as the most select young ladies'
seminary.</p>

<p>This is the invariable course of events. On
the particular occasion I am about to describe&mdash;the
election of 1905&mdash;the candidates announced
in the spring were Lord Linlithgow (Conservative)
and Mr. Asquith (Liberal). The Liberals
had lost the last election badly, but the reaction
against the Government gave them high hopes
of pulling their man through on this occasion.</p>

<p>The summer, apart from the publishing of one
magazine by the Liberals, was, as usual, a time
of public inaction, but secret preparations. The
clubs rented two large shops&mdash;almost next door
to one another, by mutual arrangement&mdash;in a
street near the University. These were the
"committee rooms," and were practically the
head-quarters from which the fighting was done.
They were prepared for occupation by (1) removing
all partitions and throwing the shop
itself and the rooms behind into one large, bare
apartment. (2) Taking out all fittings, even to
the fire-grates. (3) Taking out the windows
and filling their place with very massive,
buttressed barricades, having loopholes high up.
(4) Leading in special water supplies and fitting
hydrants for hoses. In addition, the cellars are
stocked with great cases of pease-meal, made
up into paper packets of convenient size for
throwing. A piano was also placed in each of
the committee rooms.</p>

<p>About the 20th of October students rattled
back to their Alma Mater from all parts of the
country with an eager lust for the coming fray.
For myself I can solemnly say that the ensuing
fortnight was the happiest time I have ever had.

THE "ARTICLES OF WAR," PUBLISHED BY
BOTH CLUBS IN THESE MAGAZINES.
</div>

<p>The atmosphere was something different from
the rest of life; it was like a
slice out of the Middle Ages.
Up all night and sleeping
during the day, life became
for us a complicated mass
of plottings and intrigues,
ambushes, wild chases in
cabs, men spying on other
men and in turn being
shadowed themselves. Last,
but by no means least, there
was the unholy but very real
joy that comes of the unlicensed
destruction of property.
A Rectorial election
is the shortest road to
romance in this prosaic
modern life that I know of.</p>

<p>The canvass, though very
efficient, is comparatively
routine work, and naturally
neither particularly novel
nor interesting. I shall pass
it over and deal mainly with
the fighting. There were
four chief features in the
fighting&mdash;"painting raids,"
"regular battles," "magazine
captures," and "bus fights."</p>

<p>At this election some attempt
was made for the first
time to restrain and organize
the fighting. It was thought
that it would be better to
have something in the way
of fixed battles by mutual
agreement rather than or in
addition to the constant
running fight. Consequently
truces were frequently
arranged, except at the
times fixed on for battles.
These truces, however, were
technically held not to
inhibit painting raids.</p>

<p>The front of each of the committee-rooms
was, of course, loudly painted with the party
colour&mdash;red for the Liberals, blue for the Conservatives.
A painting raid meant stealing out
at dead of night, with paint-buckets and brushes,
and daubing the enemy's rooms your own colour.</p>

<p>Our opponents, however, sometimes received
information beforehand in some mysterious way.
The painters would be softly busy, with a whish-whish
of brushes, chuckling to one another,
when suddenly, without a whisper of warning,
two deadly streams of water would pour an
irresistible cross-fire from the loopholes and
sweep painters, chairs, and ladders to the ground
in a confused, dripping
mass. Then there was much
spluttering and vociferation,
and, if possible, the contents
of the paint-buckets
were made to shoot through
the loopholes. The barricades,
however, were invulnerable,
and the hoses could
not be withstood. If the
enemy are prepared for a
painting raid there is little
to do but retire.</p>

<p>In this sort of work it was
pretty well give-and-take;
both sides painted and were
painted. The raids, however,
ceased once the regular
fighting commenced.</p>

<p>This happened a few days
later, when the "articles of
war," here reproduced, were
published by both clubs in
their magazines.</p>

<p>The "open doors" article
was new. It came of past
experience. If the massive
doors of a committee-room
were closed, obviously the
only way of getting at those
inside was with axes and
heavy rams, with results
and risks, in excited hands,
rather more serious than
the clubs were prepared to
face. It turned out a wise
step, for it had the effect
of making the fights more
physical and good-humoured,
and in all probability prevented
a great deal of serious
injury and wounding.</p>

<p>The article about pianos
was, strangely enough,
strictly kept. It was a striking
sight at the end of a "wrecking" to see
the piano standing unhurt and immaculate amid
a chaos of torn flooring and broken plaster.</p>

<p>The matriculation and class tickets of a
student are what make him eligible to vote, and
would cost at least four guineas to replace. To
make war on these would be a shabby way of
winning an election.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>Though it was the "open season," so to
speak, after October 25th very little fighting
was done by the rank and file except at the
battles. The clubs concentrated all their
energies on these. The occasions were arranged
beforehand, and there were four
altogether.</p>

<p>On the evening of the first battle students
arrived in the oldest rags they could lay hands
on. A great crowd of spectators also turned
up, the time of the engagement having leaked
out. The crowd was kept back by a force of
policemen. Inside the rooms busy preparations
were going on. Boxes of pease-meal bags were
hauled up from the cellar and served out to all
hands&mdash;if you were clever you might manage to
carry ten of these most effective missiles. The
hoses were fixed up and tested, while men who
were not willing to submit even the worst
clothes they had to the combined effect of
pease-meal and water stripped until they were
clad only in the sparsest of underwear.</p>

<p>The Liberals&mdash;of whom I may as well confess
at once I was one&mdash;divided their force. About
two-thirds were detailed for attack, and the
remainder had to stay by the rooms and defend
them in case of need. This boldness was
because we had been assured by our scouts that
we were largely in the majority. The Conservatives,
realizing their weakness, only threw
perhaps a quarter of their number outside.</p>

<p>A few minutes before the hour the attacking
forces lined up opposite their doors, facing one
another. They looked a queer lot, in most
grotesque attire&mdash;the first pease-meal bag ready
in each man's right hand, their figures bulging
with the remainder. In the rooms the defending
forces were massed at the open doors, while
at each loophole were two men controlling the
nozzle of a hose. These waited anxiously, for
the result of the collision of the outside forces
determined whose rooms were to be attacked.</p>

<p>On this occasion, however, there was little
doubt. The odds were so clearly against the
Conservatives that, unless they had some stratagem
up their sleeve (which was always very
possible), it was decidedly to be the Liberals'
night.</p>

<p>The good-natured and even sympathetic police-inspector
in charge capped the official sanction
by consenting to blow his whistle to start us.
He stood, watch in hand, with the whistle
between his lips and his eyes on the minute-hand.
Dead silence prevailed all around.</p>

<p>Suddenly the whistle shrilled out, the crowd
shouted, and the two forces rushed at one
another, the narrowing space between them
netted with the parabolas of pease-meal bags,
which burst like shells where they struck. The
concussion of the adversaries took place somewhere
in the midst of a dense cloud of fine
yellow dust. But out of that cloud, in the
direction of the Blue rooms, there emerged a
writhing bulk of men. It was body to body
now; there was throwing only on the outskirts.</p>

<p>The Liberals were as three to one, and the
Blues were crumpled up and driven before us.
Our advance was irresistible; there was no
stand or halt until they had retreated right into
their rooms. In less than thirty seconds from
the whistle we were in the Conservative doorway.</p>

<p>But there we stopped, for all their defence
was opposed to us. In that doorway there was
a tight, breathless jam&mdash;as severe an experience
as I ever want to have. Our own men from the
outside and the Tories from the back poured in
a steady fusillade of pease-meal, of which the
doorway was the focus. The pease-meal bag
does not injure, but if it explodes in the face
it fills mouth, nose, ears, and lungs with its
nauseous, choking dust. Here there were
hundreds bursting within a few square feet.
The atmosphere was unimaginable.</p>

<p>With eyes tightly shut&mdash;one could not see an
eighth of an inch if they were open&mdash;jammed
off one's feet, and with a roaring in the ears,
we remained there, unable even to think, but
possessed with one insensate idea&mdash;to shove,
shove, shove, whenever we could get the slightest
purchase.</p>

<p>And presently the hoses were at it. The
enemy had brought them away from the loopholes
(where they were useless) and taken them
back into the room. From there they played
relentlessly on the jam in the door, the solid
jets striking like rods of iron.</p>

<p>Behind us there were gusts of charging that
shook our wedged mass. Parties of half-a-dozen
would run back ten yards and then hurl
themselves in a solid body at the pack. But
still the Tories defended their citadel most
pluckily, holding on to the doorway with
desperate tenacity.</p>

<p>But steps were being taken to help us. In
the Liberal rooms a small party of trusted men
descended to the cellar. There, by crawling
through holes and breaking down brick partitions,
they arrived at length at the foundations
of the block of buildings. Here they found a
network of water-pipes, but to fix on the one
which led to the Conservative rooms was a
difficult job. While they were still hesitating,
word came down to them that their men in the
street above were having an awful time with the
hoses. A big main pipe was obvious, and one
of the band, equipped with an axe, speedily
severed it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 443px;">
<img src="images/i0025.jpg" width="443" height="550" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"IN THAT DOORWAY THERE WAS A TIGHT, BREATHLESS JAM."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile, up above, the streams of water
were playing splendidly. They could not break
the jam, but they prevented and smashed up
any attempt at organized effort on the outskirts
of the attack. Suddenly, however, they stuttered,
leapt out high, and then fell to the merest
dribble. From our packed ranks there rose a
muffled growl, which was meant for a cheer.
With the chief obstacle removed&mdash;it is wonderful
how a hose deters men&mdash;we began steadily
to gain.</p>

<p>That terrible jam had lasted for nearly half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
an hour. The men in the forefront of the
attack had long ago become exhausted, but
unlimited energy came from behind. I felt
myself scrape along the wall. Suddenly the
resistance in front gave way and we staggered
forward, our mass opening out like a fan. In
another instant we were all inside.</p>

<p>Personally, I was content to lie on the floor
in a corner; my eyes were bloodshot, and my
nose bleeding from inhaled pease-meal. But
fresher men set about the wrecking of the
premises, and presently I, too, joined them with
zest, while the defeated Conservatives looked on
indifferently or jokingly proffered assistance.</p>

<p>The unsophisticated reader may think there
is little to destroy in a room with bare walls and
floor, but we found quite a lot. There was the
woodwork to tear off, the plaster of walls and
ceiling to be broken and poked down. The
doors were detached and thrown in the Kelvin,
a very convenient river, along with much other
stuff. The gas-pipes for obvious reasons were
inviolable, but much of the water-piping was
destroyed, and in addition two hoses, a large
supply of pease-meal, and a storming platform
were captured and transferred to the Liberal
rooms.</p>

<p>Thereafter a joint smoking-concert was held
in the Liberal rooms, as being in their present
state more comfortable, and both sides had a
very jolly and friendly time, not at all disturbed
by a party of policemen and plumbers, who
came round with some strange story of a burst
pipe they had to locate.</p>

<p>Two days later the second fight took place.
The Reds were again in a large majority, and
forced the Tory rooms in less than twenty
minutes. Very little had been done in the way
of repairing damages, and there was, consequently,
not much scope for the wreckers.
Nevertheless, there were some who were not
discouraged, but did their best under the
circumstances. If a barrel of dynamite had
been exploded in the rooms they could not
have looked more forlorn and dislocated than
they did after this second visitation.</p>

<p>The third fight took place very late in the
evening, because it followed a Liberal meeting
in the St. Andrew's Hall, addressed by Mr.
Lloyd George.</p>

<p>The Conservatives acted on the defensive all
through this fight, and never left their rooms.
For over an hour we tried to effect an entrance,
but all in vain. We were baffled by a clever
system of railing, rigged up to lead from each
side of the door into the middle of the room.
Almost across this passage was a platform. To
enter the room one had to traverse this nine or
ten feet of narrow gangway with the enemy
massed behind the railing on each side, and
dead in the face of a powerful hose which was
stationed on the platform and had a clear sweep
down the passage. Moreover, a special, inaccessible
water-pipe, which our underground
scouts were unable to discover, had been led
into the building.</p>

<p>It was an impossible task. After many weary
efforts we gave it up, and this fight was declared
a draw.</p>

<p>The fourth was the last fight. We had so far
had all the advantage. The enemy's rooms
had been twice wrecked; ours were untouched.
In this last fight the Tories made a big effort to
equalize, while, for our part, we were rather
slack.</p>

<p>The result was that for the first time they
outnumbered us. At the very start we were
swept off our feet and beaten back to our
rooms. Our water supply was cut off, leaving
only a feeble trickle, which was refreshing rather
than otherwise. For an hour and a quarter we
held them out; then we broke, and five minutes
later the interiors of the two committee-rooms
were as like each other as&mdash;well, as they were
like anything.</p>

<p>In addition to these fixed battles there were
constantly little skirmishes in which half-a-dozen
or fewer might be engaged on each side. These
mostly centred round attempts to capture the
literature of one party or the other.</p>

<p>The literature was inviolable at the printers'
and inviolable when it was up at college and
being distributed, but it was liable to be seized
at any point in transit. The respective printers
are, of course, pledged to secrecy, and, to do
them justice, for staid commercial men they
enter into the spirit of the thing with uncommon
zest. So much so, that on one occasion two
genuine young Liberals, who had been sent for
some printed matter with insufficient credentials,
were suspected by our wily printers of being
Tory spies, and were accordingly decoyed into
a room, locked up for an hour or so, and
finally unceremoniously bundled downstairs.</p>

<p>But, though the firm may be thus zealous,
there are always employ&eacute;s in a large works who
are approachable, and, having unstinted money
for bribing, the enemy often get secret information
as to when a magazine may be expected to
come out.</p>

<p>During this campaign, however, though there
were many exciting cab chases and encounters,
the prize always escaped with its rightful owners.
There was no single delivery of magazines or bills
captured from either side. Once our magazine
was only saved by a ruse. Just at the time of
dispatch a party of Tories was observed in
waiting. The convoy was not strong enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
run any risks, and had to use their wits to save
the precious publications. A large number of
cabs was promptly summoned by telephone
from the nearest cab office. They all gathered
round the printers' door. Into one of the cabs
the magazine was carried and hidden. All the
vehicles then drove off simultaneously in
different directions. Of course, the right cab
escaped.</p>

<p>The literature of the campaign, I may mention
here, is delightful when one is "in the know."
Unrestrained personalities are bandied backwards
and forwards in elegant Billingsgate with
quite remarkable freedom, but for the most
part with perfect good-humour.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>GLASGOW UNIVERSITY&mdash;IT IS ON THE TERRACE IN FRONT THAT THE FINAL BATTLE RAGES ON ELECTION DAY.</p>

<p><em>From a Photograph.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>The Liberals, being in funds, published eight
full magazines during the campaign, the Conservatives
not so many. Only professional
journalists will appreciate the strain on amateurs
of putting forth a series of eight or twelve-paged
magazines at intervals of a couple of days.</p>

<p>I have all the magazines before me now.
They are full of cleverness both in writing and
caricature, but they are so essentially topical
and personal that it is difficult to make extracts
that would be understood by the non-University
reader.</p>

<p>At length the final day of the struggle came
round. The election took place on the first
Saturday in November. At an unearthly hour
of the morning parties of Reds and Blues were
out pasting their bills all over the town, on
whatever flat surface they could find. These
parties met sometimes, and bills were captured
or lost and paste used as an offensive and
defensive weapon.</p>

<p>An hour or two later began the last feature of
the campaign&mdash;the bus fights.</p>

<p>Between seven and eight in the morning each
club sends anything from a dozen to twenty
buses to outlying parts of the city and to all
the principal railway stations. Nominally, and
probably originally, these buses were meant to
collect voters. Now their chief mission is to
hunt and destroy one another.</p>

<p>Each bus is manned by about a dozen men.
It carries also a few boxes of pease-meal, but
not many. There is a new weapon to-day, in
abundant rows of cardboard boxes&mdash;rotten eggs.
Up to the day of election it is considered bad
form to throw anything but pease-meal. But
on election day everything is permitted&mdash;soot,
red and blue ochre, and, above all, rotten eggs.</p>

<p>When two hostile buses sight one another&mdash;and
that is no very rare occurrence, since they
are dispatched to the same districts&mdash;the crews
descend and fight in the streets, unless the crew
of one bus sees itself outmanned, when it may
fly and be chased at breakneck speed, to the
consternation and dislocation of the regular
street traffic. Otherwise the crews fight in the
street until one of the parties is beaten and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
forced back into its bus. They must defend
this, whip up the horses, and try to escape. On
the other hand, the assailants endeavour to
cover the approach of one of their number who
carries a long sharp knife. It is his business
to cut the traces and prevent the enemy's
escape.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 441px;">

<div class="caption"><p>"WE SURGED ROUND THE 'FRONT' IN A PERPETUAL RUGBY 'SCRUM.'"</p></div>
</div>

<p>If they are successful in doing this they put
the vanquished bus <i lang="fr">hors de combat</i> altogether by
cutting the harness to pieces and sending the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
grinning driver back to the stables with the horses.
The bus on which I was had the good fortune
to win its first fight. The combat was long and
doubtful, and, incidentally, it took place in one
of the busiest streets in Glasgow. All the time
it lasted policemen held up the traffic on either
side. When we had finished there were rows of
electric cars packed behind one another, up the
street and down; half Glasgow seemed to be
waiting patiently while a score of young men
exchanged hostilities.</p>

<p>When the battle was over we gave the policemen
a hand to drag the dismantled bus of our
enemy up a side-street. After that we were
joined by a crew of Liberals who had been dispossessed
in a similar manner. Thus brought
to double strength, we soon scored another easy
victory. Then we had a long stern chase after
a fugitive bus. It ended fruitlessly, because
we were overloaded.</p>

<p>Finally we made our way to the University,
where polling was in progress all the forenoon.</p>

RESULT OF THE POLL IS DECLARED.</p>

<p><em>From a photograph.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>A pease-mealy,
egg-plastered
crowd we were, as
we surged round
the "Front" in
a perpetual
Rugby "scrum."
The game here
was to get possession
of the doors
and pass only
your own men
in. The Liberals
succeeded in
doing this for a
time, but out
came the Clerk
of Senate and
announced that
unless the formation
were broken
the election
would cease. As
we had only
sporting reasons
for this policy&mdash;we
knew we were
going to win; the
canvass had
shown that&mdash;we
dropped it, and,
apart from a few
local centres of
disturbance, and
the perpetual
pease-meal, soot,
and rotten eggs,
we became quite pastorally happy and peaceful.
The election goes by a majority of "nations."
There are four of these nations&mdash;Glottiana,
Rothesiana, Transforthiana, and Loudoniana.
Every student belongs to and votes in one of
these, according to his birthplace. Thus it is possible
for a majority of votes to lose the election
if they happened to be massed in one nation.</p>

<p>The result is announced about one o'clock
from the balcony. The "Front" is packed with
buses and carriages swarming with students.
Long rows of hansoms contain the "Q.M.'s"&mdash;our
girl students. They vote as well, but at
their own college. I have not said anything
about them during the campaign because all
they do is to canvass and make rosettes.</p>

<p>Presently the white-bearded figure appeared
on the balcony. For five minutes it was hopeless
for him to attempt to speak. Then his lips
moved and his beard wagged, and instantly there
began a gradual, slow-swelling yell of terrific
volume. Those near who had heard his words
shouted them to
those far off:
"Asquith is in in
four nations!"</p>

<p>Then the
buses careered
wildly round the
town for an hour
or two and the
good folk of
Glasgow grinned
tolerantly, as is
their way. Last
of all we went
home. It was
finished, and we
were dying for a
long, long sleep.</p>

<p>In conclusion,
for those who
wish to follow the
Rectorial campaign
at present
in progress in
Glasgow, I would
point out that by
a rearrangement
which has just
come into force
the session now
begins on October
9th, and the
election will take
place on October
24th, instead of
in November as
heretofore.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It has always been our rule, in order to obtain accurate pictures, to entrust the illustration of our
stories only to artists who have actually visited or lived in the various countries referred to, and are
consequently familiar with the conditions of life prevailing there. The result of this custom is that
our artistic staff is composed of men who have travelled extensively, roughing it in many remote
parts of the world. In the course of their journeyings our illustrators have themselves met with
exciting and unusual experiences, some of the most interesting of which are here given, each artist
depicting his own adventure.</p></div>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">That</span> the artists who illustrate the
stories in <span class="smcap">The Wide World Magazine</span>
are recruited from a specially-qualified
staff is, we venture to think,
an obvious fact. Our stories, dealing
as they do with stirring adventures and
strange happenings, ranging in their <em>locale</em> from
our own shores to the uttermost ends of the
earth, could not, of necessity, receive adequate
and accurate pictorial embellishment save at the
hands of experts&mdash;men, in fact, who have themselves
had experience of the world in its most
varied aspects.</p>

<p>Our illustrators must, indeed, have in them
something of the soldier, the sailor, the hunter,
the cowboy, or the explorer to find a place in
our pages. Thus, should we have a story
dealing with Patagonia, the pictures are drawn
by an artist who has actually visited that
remote country; when it is necessary to illustrate
a scene in the Arctic we employ an artist
to whom the everlasting ice is as familiar as the
streets of London. Should we find it necessary
to depict a marine incident we have recourse to
the brush of an artist who has himself been a
sailor. In connection with every story we consult
our list of "specials" for one who has either
met with a like experience or is thoroughly
familiar with the country concerned. Thus it
will be seen that <span class="smcap">The Wide World</span> is able to
avail itself of the pictorial services of an
altogether exceptional body of men, many of
whom have themselves met with thrilling
adventures. As their experiences will have a
particular interest for our readers, we are glad to
be able to give an account of the most exciting
episodes in the lives of some of the artists
whose work has been a prominent feature in this
magazine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Henry Sandham is a <span class="smcap">Wide World</span> artist
who has had a distinguished and adventurous
career. By birth a Canadian, of British descent,
he has seen much of the world in out-of-the-way
places. He has hunted on the north
shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and has
probably travelled North America as extensively
as any man living, his sketching trips having
taken him from the north of Canada to the
south of the United States, and across country
from the Atlantic to the Pacific. He served his
time in the Canadian Volunteer Artillery and
saw active service during the Fenian raid on
Canada in 1864. Much to the consternation of
his friends, he once set off on a tour with a
notorious desperado known as "Curley Bill," a
"bad man," whose boast it was that he could
not sleep unless he shot a man per month; if
troubled with insomnia, he said, he shot an
extra one. Mr. Sandham roughed it for some
time with this fire-eating companion, who tended
him with a solicitude only equalled by that of a
mother for her only child; all he could beg,
borrow, or steal he cheerfully placed at the
artist's disposal. They were attended by a
dwarf, cousin to "Curley Bill," who, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
of diminutive stature, was quite as desperate a
ruffian as his bigger relative, whom he venerated
with an ardour amounting to hero-worship, and
whose dress, manners, and habits he followed
as closely as he could. "Curley No. 2," as he
was called, nearly got the party into serious
trouble by wanting to shoot a too-inquisitive
miner, and was only prevented from so doing
by "Curley Bill" himself, who took him by the
nape of his neck and shook him as a dog does
a rat.</p>

<p>Mr. Sandham has visited the West India
Islands, the Azores, Italy, France, Germany,
and Holland. He is a Charter member of the
Royal Canadian Academy, and President
Roosevelt accorded him the signal honour of
selecting him to illustrate his book of hunting
adventures.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>MR. HENRY SANDHAM, WHO, IN ATTEMPTING TO RESCUE A
DROWNING MINER, NEARLY LOST HIS OWN LIFE.</p>

<p><em>From a Photo, by Elliott &amp; Fry.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Among his varied experiences Mr. Sandham
has had several narrow escapes from death, and
on one occasion in particular the perilous position
in which he was placed might well have
been a creation of the
brain of Edgar Allan Poe
rather than an experience
from real life.</p>

<p>It was in August, 1882,
during a sketching tour
in California, that Mr.
Sandham met with this
alarming adventure.
Accompanied by a
brother artist, he paid a
visit to the Little Sailor
Mine, which is situated
on a spur of the Sierra
Madre Mountains, by the
side of the Sacramento
River, some fifty miles
from San Francisco. The
manager of the mine, in
which hydraulic power is
used, invited Mr. Sandham
to accompany him
on the occasion of the
monthly clean-up of the
gold in the tunnels.
Always anxious to add
to his store of information,
the artist gladly
accepted the invitation,
asking at the same time that his friend might
join the party, to which request the manager
readily assented.</p>

<p>On the following day Mr. Sandham was on
the spot at the appointed time, eager for what
was to him an entirely novel experience. His
friend, however, was late, and he decided to wait
for him. As subsequent events proved, Mr.
Sandham owes his life entirely to this trivial
incident! The manager and his staff of assistants,
anxious to start the work of cleaning up
without delay, thereupon entered the tunnel,
which had been cut through a high bluff to allow
the water a free passage to the Sacramento
River, several thousand feet below the level of
the mine.</p>

<p>While waiting for his friend, Mr. Sandham
employed his time in making a sketch of the
only "monitor" (delivery-nozzle) then working,
and the man in charge of it sauntered over
to watch the progress of his facile pencil. Before
his sketch was finished Mr. Sandham noticed
that the "monitor," which had hitherto been
throwing a regular jet of water at a terrific
pressure, by means of which the solid rock was
literally washed away, had become spasmodic in
its action. Curious to learn the reason, he
called the miner's attention to the fact. To his
utter astonishment the engineer received his
remark with the utmost consternation, and,
throwing up his hands
with a gesture of despair,
shrieked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good heavens! The
pipe has burst, and all the
boys will be drowned!"</p>

<p>With that he at once
dashed off frantically
in the direction of the
signal-station to order the
water to be turned off
at the upper reservoir,
which was situated many
hundred feet above the
level of the mine, and
was fed from the Sierra
Madre Mountains, twenty
miles away. Meanwhile
Mr. Sandham realized
that with the bursting of
the pipe the tunnel must
have been instantly
flooded with an immense
volume of water, and that
the unfortunate manager
and his staff were caught
like rats in a trap. At that
very moment they were,
without a doubt, fighting
desperately for their lives. With characteristic
energy Mr. Sandham's one desire was to help in
the work of rescue, but the very thought of the
men's seemingly hopeless plight left him with
a sickening feeling of impotency. He quickly
decided, however, that the one place where he
might be of use was at the outer end of the
tunnel, from which the escaping waters rushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
headlong over a precipice, to fall in a series of
frightful leaps some thousands of feet into the
river far below. To reach this spot Mr. Sandham
had to climb the high bluff through which
the tunnel was cut, and descend the almost perpendicular
cliff on the other side. The climb
itself was no mean test of a man's agility and
nerve, but Mr. Sandham has both, and he was
soon at the summit. As to how he got down
the other side Mr. Sandham says he is to this
day not quite clear, but judging from his
battered and bleeding condition and the state
of his clothing afterwards he thinks he must
have done so by alternately falling and sliding.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i0032.jpg" width="700" height="597" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"MONITORS" AT WORK&mdash;THE PRESSURE OF THE WATER IS SO TERRIFIC THAT THE SOLID ROCK IS LITERALLY WASHED AWAY.
OUR ILLUSTRATION IS FROM A DRAWING MADE BY MR. SANDHAM WHILE IN CALIFORNIA.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Exhausted and breathless, he finally reached
the short section of the flume, immediately under
the outlet of the tunnel, leading to the edge of
the precipice. At that instant a dark object shot
like a ball from a cannon out of the cavern into
the flume, and was carried along and swept over
the edge of the cliff. Mr. Sandham discovered
afterwards that this was the body of the ill-fated
mine-manager. After an interval of a few
seconds another body was fired out of the
tunnel, and as it swept down the flume towards
him Mr. Sandham instinctively reached out
his arm to catch it. Next instant his hand
was grasped with a convulsive grip, the man's
body swung out to the rush of the water, and
Mr. Sandham knew that on the strength of his
arm depended a human life.</p>

<p>At first he thought he could easily rescue the
man by hauling him out of the water, but he
speedily found that this was impossible, and
that he was not only fighting for a fellow-creature's
life but for his own as well. His
position on the side of the flume afforded him
but a precarious hold, and such was the terrific
force of the racing torrent of water as it threatened
to tear the drowning miner from his grasp
that Mr. Sandham realized that he was not only
powerless to pull the man out, but that he
himself was in imminent danger of being
pulled in. Once at the mercy of the rushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
waters, no power on earth could save the pair
of them from an awful death.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 446px;">
<img src="images/i0033.jpg" width="446" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"NEXT INSTANT HIS HAND WAS GRASPED WITH A CONVULSIVE GRIP."</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is vastly to Mr. Sandham's credit that even
in this dire extremity he had no thought of
releasing his grip of the man's hand in order to
save his own life. At the same time, any such
intention on his part would have been futile,
for the frenzied miner, with the fear of death
strong upon him, held him in such a vice-like
grip that it was perfectly clear they must both
share the same fate, be it life or death.</p>

<p>The struggle was a grim one, and, putting
forth every effort he was capable of, the artist
strove hard to pull the man out of danger. His
frantic endeavours, however, were unavailing,
and he felt himself gradually slipping&mdash;drawn
irresistibly into the mill-race, which would sweep
him and the hapless miner down the flume and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
hurl them over the precipice to meet a frightful
death on the rocks far below. Meanwhile his
companion in danger was powerless to help
himself, but the agony of mind he endured was
vividly portrayed on his drawn and ghastly face
as he fought with all his strength against the
onrush of the current.</p>

<p>Slipping, slipping, inch by inch, until his
body overhung the water to a perilous extent,
Mr. Sandham felt instinctively that his strength
was failing him. A few seconds more and the
end must come! A cold sweat broke out on
his brow, and his arm felt as though it was being
wrenched from its socket. And then, suddenly,
the dreadful strain lessened. The miner, in his
frantic struggles, had managed to grasp the side
of the flume, and, with this added opposition to
the force of the water, Mr. Sandham was able to
recover his balance, and at last, with an almost
superhuman effort, he dragged the man from
the water.</p>

<p>Their peril did not end here, however, for the
force he had exerted landed the engineer on top
of the artist, and in their nervous excitement the
pair clutched each other and rolled over towards
the precipice. The rocks sloped sharply down
to the edge, and for the second time within the
space of a few seconds they were in actual
danger of their lives, for the impetus their bodies
had acquired carried them down until their
heads were actually hanging over the chasm.
"There was no earthly reason why we should
stop there," says Mr. Sandham, "save that
Providence so ordered it." But stop they did,
and in a few minutes they were able to crawl
back exhausted to a place of safety, where they
lay unable to move, speak, or even think for
some considerable time. At length the miner
sat up and said in a dazed, monotonous voice,
"The boss is gone dead, drowned like a rat in
a hole. Poor beggar, he was to have gone East
to-morrow&mdash;he had made his pile. He was
going back to his wife and kids. And I should
have died with him if you had not caught hold
of me." Then his mind seemed to clear and he
exclaimed, "Say, stranger, what particular kind
of fool are you, anyway? Because, if I had
missed my clutch on the flume side when I got
my grip on your arm, we would both be down
there, ground up into tailings. Shake, stranger."</p>

<p>He held out a huge, hairy hand, and Mr.
Sandham realized that he had received a
Western miner's heartfelt thanks for the saving
of his life.</p>

<p>The water had now been turned off at the
reservoir and, the furious torrent being thus
reduced to a mere trickle, all further danger
to those in the mine was over. The miner's
convulsive grip and the terrific strain of the
current left Mr. Sandham with a crushed
hand and badly-wrenched shoulder, the effects
of which he felt for many months.</p>

<p>Looking back to-day on his adventure Mr.
Sandham says that the point most vividly
impressed on his memory is the fact that if he
had not waited for his friend he would have
been caught with the others in the flooding
of the mine. Naturally, as the guest of the
manager, who had gone on ahead of the party,
he would have been close to him at the time
of the disaster and would undoubtedly have
shared his terrible fate. The rest of the party,
being near a manhole, luckily made their escape&mdash;all
except the foreman, who had pluckily
allowed his men to go first. His chivalry nearly
cost him his life, for he was too late to save
himself and was caught in the flood. It was he
whom Mr. Sandham so pluckily rescued.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Among the artists who have contributed to
<span class="smcap">The Wide World</span>, one of the most familiar
names is undoubtedly that of Mr. Alfred Pearse,
whose well-known signature, "A. P.," appeared
in the very first number of the magazine.</p>

<p>Mr. Pearse has met with such an extraordinary
number and variety of accidents and
adventures during his career that he says,
"There is no doubt that by all the laws of
chance I ought not to be here, but killing seems
to agree with me."</p>

<p>His list of casualties is an extraordinary one.
He has been nearly drowned three times, and
has had concussion of the brain more than
once. He has fallen off the tops of omnibuses&mdash;on
one occasion through the bus skidding
when he was on his way to Cowes to make a
sketch of Queen Alexandra's pet dogs. This
resulted in his being paralyzed in the legs for
six months, and one of his most cherished
possessions is a kindly letter of sympathy from
Her Majesty, expressing her hopes for his
speedy recovery. Mr. Pearse has been drugged,
poisoned, and shot, has fallen down Beachy
Head, and been knocked down and injured by
runaway horses and motor-cars. He has slipped
between a moving train and the platform,
has been within an ace of falling over a precipice
in the Alps, has been chased by wild bulls, been
blind for two days (the after-effects of a red
spider bite), and had his left shoulder put out
of joint. It is perhaps permissible, therefore, to
refer to him as the most "accidental" man in
the world.</p>

<p>Mr. Pearse's alarming list of mishaps, however,
does not appear to have affected him in any
way, for he is to-day as full of vigour and spirits
as many a man of half his years and considerably
less than half his accidents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>But there is one particular experience in his
life which Mr. Pearse confesses stands out above
all others in sheer intensity of horror and nerve-racking
anguish&mdash;an occasion when he was
absolutely and entirely at the mercy of a raving
lunatic. There are, it is safe to say, few men
who have been so near death and have survived
the ordeal.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>MR. ALFRED PEARSE, WHO WAS SUSPENDED OVER
THE WELL OF A DEEP STAIRCASE BY A MADMAN.</p>

<p><em>From a Photo. by Talma, Melbourne.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>This alarming adventure
dates back to Mr. Pearse's
early manhood, and had its
inception in the introduction
into his family circle of a
certain individual who, for
obvious reasons, we shall
refer to in this narrative as
Mr. X&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>Mr. Pearse first made the
acquaintance of Mr. X&mdash;&mdash;
owing to the interest he manifested
in the affairs of the
church at which his family
attended. Mr. X&mdash;&mdash; soon
began to show a considerable
liking for Mr. Pearse,
and the close friendship
which ensued led to the latter's father inviting
Mr. X&mdash;&mdash; to his house, where he soon
became a welcome visitor. He was undoubtedly
an interesting personality, although
even at this time he was regarded as being
somewhat strange in his manner and subject to
hallucinations. For instance, he once declared
that he had caused the death of his wife, and
also that he took a delight in poisoning his
neighbours' dogs and then offering a reward for
the apprehension of the poisoner. These wild
statements, however, were received with pity
rather than credence.</p>

<p>Mr. X&mdash;&mdash; was, according to his own account,
an Australian, and in appearance was gaunt,
large-headed, and glaring-eyed, with a scanty
beard and moustache. He stood well over
six feet in height, and was evidently of immense
muscular strength.</p>

<p>Although a man of professedly religious inclinations,
his actions were not always in keeping
with his words; and Mr. Pearse, when visiting
him at his rooms, would often find him raving
like a madman, reviling himself and those with
whom his past life had been spent. On one of
Mr. Pearse's visits he found Mr. X&mdash;&mdash; almost
delirious with laughter, owing to the fact that
his servant was seriously ill after drinking some
of his master's whisky, into which Mr. X&mdash;&mdash;,
suspecting that the man was in the habit of
helping himself, had put some laudanum.</p>

<p>On the other hand, for all his evident madness
or wickedness, there was a good side to his
character, and Mr. Pearse once saw him knock
down a bully who had insulted an old man;
while on another occasion he interfered to protect
a woman from the brutal assault of her
husband. It was simply for this reason that Mr.
Pearse endeavoured to befriend him, although
at times his conduct was such as to strain their
relations almost to breaking-point.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, X&mdash;&mdash;'s conduct
went from bad to worse,
until at length he gained
for himself an unenviable
notoriety throughout the
neighbourhood. Mr. Pearse
was still stanch to his ill-guided
friend and ready to
welcome him in his home,
but his father, having regard
to his son's welfare, could not
but regard their friendship
with considerable misgivings,
and on one of X&mdash;&mdash;'s
periodical visits he was reluctantly
compelled to forbid
him the house. X&mdash;&mdash;
received the ultimatum in sullen silence, and
with a vindictive scowl on his face he took
his departure.</p>

<p>Mr. Pearse was at the time studying wood-engraving
with Messrs. Nicholls and Aldridge
at 13, Paternoster Row, and one afternoon
shortly afterwards he was considerably surprised
when Mr. Nicholls came into the office and
said, "Who is that madman sitting on the
stairs?"</p>

<p>Naturally enough the young artist's first
thoughts were of Mr. X&mdash;&mdash;, and he immediately
ran out on to the landing to investigate. There,
sure enough, seated on the top stair, was the
familiar figure of X&mdash;&mdash;, wearing a "wideawake"
hat and Inverness cape.</p>

<p>They were on the top floor of the building,
and there was a large well staircase with a sheer
drop of sixty feet straight down to the hall
below. Mr. X&mdash;&mdash;, whose eyes were staring
wildly and whose every feature was working convulsively,
dropped his hat and umbrella at sight
of Mr. Pearse, and without a word seized him
by the collar of his coat and the left arm and
forced him towards the banisters. So sudden
was the onslaught that the young man had no
time even to call for assistance, but he nevertheless
realized his peril and struggled desperately
in the grip of the madman. Mr. Pearse was not
only young but slight of build for his age, and
despite his efforts he was quite powerless in
the hands of X&mdash;&mdash;, who, with the almost
supernatural strength of a maniac, lifted him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
apparently
without effort,
clean over the
banisters, and
held him suspended
in mid-air
over the
abyss, with nothing but sixty feet of air between
him and the stone floor below.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px;">
<img src="images/i0036.jpg" width="520" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"HE HISSED IN A COLD, HARD VOICE, 'I ALWAYS REPAY! I AM GOING TO
DROP YOU, ALFRED; AREN'T YOU AFRAID?'"</p></div>
</div>

<p>Even in this awful extremity the one idea
uppermost in the artist's mind was as to his best
means of escape. Could he clutch hold of anything
before the crash came? Could he swing
himself on to the next landing or cling to his
captor? X&mdash;&mdash;, however, was too cunning in
his methods to allow of any such man&#339;uvres,
and Mr. Pearse
soon realized that
he was absolutely
and entirely at the
mercy of a raving
lunatic, and that
his life depended,
small though the chance was, on his own coolness
and resource.</p>

<p>At that critical moment, curiously enough,
the young man's chief concern was for the
welfare of a friend of his, also studying wood-engraving,
who had followed him from the
office, and who, with bulging eyes, open
mouth, and face ghastly green with fright,
was a horrified witness of the proceedings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
pressing back against the panelled wall as if he
wished he might vanish through it. Mr. Pearse
devoutly hoped the young fellow would remain
quiet, for the slightest movement, he felt convinced,
would hasten his own end. Fortunately,
however, he was too petrified by fear to
be capable of action or speech.</p>

<p>Thoughts of his mother and her anguish at
his tragic death next took possession of Mr.
Pearse's mind, but his desire to live and the
necessity for concentrating his thoughts on his
terrible plight were suddenly brought back to
him by Mr. X&mdash;&mdash;, who hissed in a cold, hard
voice, "I always repay! I am going to drop
you, Alfred; aren't you afraid?"</p>

<p>Mr. Pearse was firmly convinced that his last
hour had come, but summoning all his fortitude
and exerting his will-power to the utmost he
replied without the slightest hesitation, "No;
for I know you will put me back."</p>

<p>The apparent coolness and indifference with
which the young artist replied were without
doubt the means of his salvation, for the madman,
with a profound sigh&mdash;as though he was
sorry, but was obliged to do so&mdash;pulled him
over the banisters and
dropped him on the landing.
Then he fled, leaving his
umbrella and hat behind him.</p>

<p>Mr. Pearse has never from
that day seen or heard of his
assailant, but even now the
mere thought of the agonizing
suspense he endured at his
hands brings with it a
shudder of horror.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>MR. A. J. GOUGH, WHO NARROWLY ESCAPED DEATH
AT THE HANDS OF AN INFURIATED COWBOY.</p>

<p><em>From a Photo. by Geo. Newnes, Ltd.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Mr. A. J. Gough is another
<span class="smcap">Wide World</span> artist&mdash;a Yorkshireman
by birth&mdash;who has
seen much of the world and
taken part in many an exciting
episode in wild and
uncivilized places.</p>

<p>His early youth was spent
in India, where his father&mdash;Mr. J. W. Gough,
the architect&mdash;was building a palace for the
Maharajah of Durbhungah; and there he met
with his first adventure, when he lost himself in
a tiger-infested jungle, and was only found by
the search-party with much difficulty.</p>

<p>Mr. Gough subsequently went to America,
where his experiences included encounters with
alligators and rattlesnakes and disputes with
"bad men" armed with bowie-knives and six-shooters.
He has won fame as an amateur
boxer, and is still a member of the Belsize Boxing
Club, being also well known as a swimmer.</p>

<p>Mr. Gough has roughed it in Florida and
Texas, and it was in the latter State that he
experienced his most alarming adventure, on
which occasion he was literally within half an
inch of death.</p>

<p>It was at the hands of a cowboy known as
"Harry" that he nearly lost his life. He
made this man's acquaintance under the following
singular circumstances. Mr. Gough and a
friend of his were on their way to Florida from
New York by steamer, and, as funds were low,
had perforce to travel steerage. Among their
fellow-passengers was a man whose appearance
clearly denoted the cowboy, and who, although
of rough exterior and manners, was evidently in
some respects fastidious in his tastes.</p>

<p>He took occasion, early in the voyage, to find
fault with the drinking water supplied in the
steerage, which was contained in a huge tin
tank. Calling the steward, he remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That there tank isn't fit for a dog to drink
out of, let alone a man."</p>

<p>"Isn't it, by gum?" replied the steward, sullenly.
"Well, you can take it from me, it's all
you'll get this voyage."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is, is it?" growled the cowboy, with
an ugly look in his eyes. "I
can tell you this, mister: if
you expect me to drink out
of that blamed horse-trough
you are blamed well mistaken!"</p>

<p>"You can take it or leave
it," replied the steward, with
an oath; "and, if you are
so mighty particular, why
don't you go first class? You
look like a millionaire, I <em>must</em>
say," he added, offensively.</p>

<p>The cowboy was by this
time livid with passion, and,
fetching his "Winchester"
from the cabin, he, without
further reply, started blazing
away at the tank, from
which the water was soon
spurting in all directions.</p>

<p>He had obviously completely lost all control
of himself, and on an attempt being made to
secure him he got his back against a bulkhead
and threatened to shoot any man who came
near him. If looks went for anything he certainly
meant it, and as no one dare approach
him he fairly "held up" the ship, or, at any
rate, the steerage.</p>

<p>In this extremity the captain was appealed to.
Seeing that he had a dangerous customer to deal
with, and being anxious to avoid bloodshed, he
pretended to side with the cowboy, telling him
he was quite right in what he had done, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
promising to see that the steerage passengers had
a better supply of drinking water. Peace being
thus restored the malcontent cooled down, and for
the rest of the voyage he was quite good-natured
and jolly, becoming the life and soul of the
ship. In fact, he became so popular that even
the captain and mate of the steamer joined in
the merrymaking which took place in the steerage.
Before the voyage was ended, Mr. Gough&mdash;then
a youngster in his teens&mdash;and Harry the
cowboy had established a firm friendship, and
this was renewed some nine months later
at Leesburg, in Florida, whither Mr. Gough
had drifted in search of work. Harry was
then ranching at Sumterville, in Texas, and
having taken a violent fancy to Mr. Gough he
offered to engage him to help with the horses,
which offer, coming as it did at an opportune
moment, was promptly accepted.</p>

<p>The cowboy was a man of about forty,
tall and loosely built, with deep-set eyes, a
bristly moustache, and a square, determined
jaw. His huge, knotted limbs gave evidence
of immense physical strength, and his brawny
chest might well have served as a model for a
sculptor. On special occasions he wore on his
breast a small solid gold model of a bull, given
him as a memento by a lady whose life he had
saved, at the imminent risk of his own, by killing
a mad bull that had attacked her, and he was
exceedingly proud of his queer medal.</p>

<p>Albeit an exceedingly rough specimen of the
uncut diamond, Harry the cowboy was, under
normal conditions, of an unusually kind and
even tender-hearted disposition, but, as this
story will show, he was subject to sudden outbursts
of temper, often for very trifling reasons,
of absolutely appalling ferocity.</p>

<p>His ranch was situated in a lonely spot, and
there for some months Mr. Gough lived a hard
and open-air life, enjoying to the full, in the
vigour of his youth and spirits, the arduous
round of a rancher's daily toil. Although now
and again his companion gave way to outbursts
of temper, there was nothing to cause him any
serious alarm.</p>

<p>Among his various duties, it fell to Mr.
Gough's lot to cook the meals. On one occasion
he had prepared a savoury dish of stew, which
he and the cowboy, at the end of a particularly
hard day's work, sat down to enjoy.</p>

<p>The manners of the establishment were, to
say the least, of a rough-and-ready description,
and the two hungry diners sat facing each other
on the floor, helping themselves from a large
iron pot.</p>

<p>Mr. Gough, as it happened, was the first to
finish his repast, and in the exuberance of a
passing fit of hilarity proceeded to execute a
<i lang="fr">pas seul</i>, hopping on each leg alternately round
the bare apartment.</p>

<p>In the course of his antics he came quite close
to the seated figure of the cowboy, who had just
helped himself to a fresh plate of stew. Then,
stumbling, he lost his balance, and fell heavily to
the ground, his foot crashing fairly into the
middle of his friend's plate.</p>

<p>Mr. Gough at once scrambled to his feet and
began to apologize in a jocular way for his
accident. "Sorry, old chap," he exclaimed; "I
hope I haven't spoilt your dinner."</p>

<p>But Harry was not at all disposed to take
the matter as a joke, and with a dangerous glare
in his eyes he half rose to his feet. "You
clumsy brute!" he shouted, angrily. "Isn't it
hard enough to earn a meal without you spoiling
it with your infernal tricks, confound you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, all right," replied Gough; "there's
plenty more, so you needn't get in a rage about it."</p>

<p>The cowboy was now absolutely beyond himself
with passion, and with twitching lips and
starting eyes he reached for his "gun." For
the moment, in fact, he was quite demented
and "saw red."</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, his revolver was not at
his side. If it had been, Mr. Gough is firmly
convinced that he would there and then have
been shot dead.</p>

<p>Deprived of this weapon Harry leapt to his
feet. "You don't spoil a man's dinner for
nothing, I can tell you," he roared, "and, by
Heaven, I'll spoil you, if I swing for it!" With
that, carried away by an ungovernable fury of
rage, he drew a gleaming bowie-knife from his
belt and rushed at Gough, who was much his
inferior in strength, and was, moreover, unarmed,
thus being apparently entirely at his mercy.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, the cowboy was
between the young artist and the door, so that
escape that way was impossible. He has never
yet been found wanting in pluck, however, and,
although he felt that his last hour had surely
come, he braced himself to meet the attack.
A rapid glance in search of a weapon of defence
showed that there was nothing within reach.
His first impulse was to grapple with his
assailant, but the odds were obviously too great,
and there was nothing for it but to await the
attack. This, mercifully, was not long in coming,
for, with the unreasoning fury of a maniac, the
cowboy made a dash for him with upraised knife.</p>

<p>A quick lunge, and the knife flashed downward.
If ever a man stood face to face with
death, Mr. Gough did during that awful second.
Instinctively he ducked and dodged the blow, the
deadly blade whizzing over his shoulder, missing
him so narrowly that it actually grazed his head!</p>

<p>Mr. Gough was standing against the wall, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
as the cowboy had literally hurled himself at him
in the intensity of his passion, the knife, driven
with all the power of Harry's immense strength,
was buried deeply in the woodwork. So firmly
was it embedded that its owner, in his blind
fury, experienced considerable difficulty in extricating
it. The consequent lull in the hostilities
gave Mr. Gough his chance, and with a flying
leap he dashed through the door and gained the
open air. Once outside the tables were turned,
for the cowboy was no match for the youngster
when it came to a test of speed.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"THE KNIFE, DRIVEN WITH ALL THE POWER OF HARRY'S IMMENSE STRENGTH, WAS BURIED DEEPLY IN THE WOODWORK."</p></div>
</div>

<p>This he soon realized, and in a few moments
he calmed down. As his brain cleared the
frightful possibilities of his murderous outbreak
dawned on him, and with sincere and abject
repentance in every look he exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come inside, old chap. I was mad, and
I'm sorry I made a fool of myself. Here's my
hand on it. Shake."</p>

<p>Mr. Gough took the proffered hand and there
and then made up the quarrel, but very wisely
he decided not to risk the chances of another
similar outburst, and so shortly afterwards he
said good-bye to Harry the cowboy and secured
work elsewhere.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">To</span> the ordinary reader the name of
Tierra del Fuego probably suggests
a region about as remote and unfamiliar
as any outside the Arctic
regions. Yet the country, far away
though it is, is not really difficult of access.
The Straits of Magellan are daily traversed by
ocean-going steamers, all of which stop at Sandy
Point on the mainland, just opposite this forbidding
island. Thousands of voyagers annually
pass through the Straits and, if the weather is
fine, behold the snowy mountains on the
southern horizon; but very few stop by the way,
and fewer still ever cross to the inhospitable
shore opposite. Nothing more bleak and uninviting,
indeed, can be imagined than the
shores of Magellan's Straits. The weather is
generally abominable. Rain falls in soaking
torrents. The lower slopes and flats are
covered with dense, reeking forests. Higher
up comes the snow, which gradually looms
forth in a pallid, death-like whiteness out
of the heavy clouds, very different in aspect
from the splendid brilliancy of Alpine snows,
standing forth against
radiant, sunlit skies. In
fine summer weather
Alpine snows attract a man
upwards; their loveliness
seems to invite a visit. It
is far otherwise in the
Fuegian archipelago.
There the great range of
Andes sinks into the ocean,
its peaks become islands,
and its valleys are straits
or fjords. You must go by
water to the foot of each
mountain, and the navigation
is difficult and often
dangerous. Not far away
is the raging ocean, everlastingly
tortured by storm
and tempest. A black
cloud roof generally passes
overhead, dragging skirts of hail, rain, or
snow over the reeking earth. Never is the
whole round of view clear. Now one region is
blotted out and now another. If the sun shines
for a little while it is soon obscured, and storm
succeeds after a short interval.</p>

OF THE COUNTRY.</p>

<p><em>From a Photograph.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>To an explorer, nevertheless, this region has
great attractions, owing to these very facts.
There is so much to discover, the scenery is so
unusual, and there is the possibility of adventure
at every step. All is uncertain, and the way has
almost to be felt. Moreover, if perchance a
fine interval comes, the storm-riven, ice-sheathed
landscape is so astounding, the effects of light
in so dense and wet an atmosphere are so extraordinary,
that it is impossible to resist their
fascination. Add to all this the spice of
danger which still remained when I was there,
and perhaps still remains. The natives were
distinctly hostile to the white man. They were
few in number, an amphibious race living in
booths, practically in the Stone Age so far as
tools and weapons were concerned; not very
dangerous foes, therefore, yet subtle, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
delighted to slay a white man if they got
the chance. They would overpower him in
his sleep, or lie in wait for him in the dense
forest, through which they can travel far faster
than he can. Many a man has been killed by
them with their stone or glass-pointed arrows,
shot out of the dense bush from the distance of
only a yard or two. When I was lying in a
small launch off the foot of one of the mountains,
in the blackest darkness of a stormy night,
a canoe laden with such Indians crept silently
up alongside in the shadow of overhanging
trees. Had we not been on the alert they
would have tried to rush our boat, but, finding
that impossible, they as silently glided away;
and no trace of them was anywhere discoverable
when morning dawned, though no doubt
they were hidden somewhere near at hand and
kept us under close observation.</p>

<p>As we came into the maze
of channels which surround
and penetrate the mountains,
though we saw no Indians, we
were aware that our coming
was noticed, because at different
points columns of smoke
arose into the air. It is thus
that the savages communicate
with one another. They have
a smoke language, and news
is passed quickly and silently
from group to group. It was
only when we landed and
climbed to a high point overlooking
the channels that we
realized what was going on;
for then we were able to observe
the columns of smoke in a dozen
or more different places&mdash;signals
of our movements, spreading
gradually over the archipelago
from family to family of scattered
Indians.</p>

</div>

<p>The great mountain in this
part of the world is Mount Sarmiento.
It is only seven thousand
two hundred feet high, but
its glaciers reach to the sea, so
that it may be compared on an
equality, from a climbing point
of view, with Mont Blanc, if that
be thought of as sunk into water
up to the snow region. On clear
days Sarmiento is visible to
voyagers through Magellan's
Straits. It is a glorious mountain,
surrounded by many other
noble peaks. In form it is of
supreme beauty, and its surroundings are of
the most romantic character. It was this peak,
of course, that I desired to attempt, and I
stopped at Sandy Point for that purpose.
After much trouble I obtained the loan of a
steam-launch for a few days, and set forth in
the usual bad weather. We voyaged up various
channels, between steep hillsides streaming with
more waterfalls than, I think, can elsewhere
exist in an equal area. In Cascade Reach, for
instance, there are literally hundreds of them,
succeeding one another every few yards.</p>

<p>After a day's steaming we reached the foot
of our peak, and with much difficulty found a
treacherous anchorage. There were clouds
everywhere above and below, and wooded banks
loomed dimly into view close at hand; but
towards sunset there were signs of the weather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
clearing up. It was one of those slow midsummer
sunsets of high latitudes, when the
colour comes very gradually and fades equally
slowly. At first only the icy base of the
mountain was visible in the grey shadow of
clouds, with the dark forest ring around it,
and the calm, black water below. Presently a
soft, pink light crept up the tumbled ruin of the
glacier, higher and higher, as the mist dissolved,
and revealed steep ice walls scarred by serrated
ridges, and a great ar&ecirc;te set with pinnacles of
splintered rock. Some white points on the
summit crest appeared, but a soft cloud floated
just above them, enveloping the top. Suddenly&mdash;so
suddenly that all who
saw cried out&mdash;away above
this cloud, surprisingly high,
appeared a point of light,
as it were a brightly glowing
coal. The fiery glow
crept down and down till
we beheld the likeness of
a great pillar of red fire. It
was a tower of ice-crusted
rock reflecting the bright
afterglow of sunset. Regathered
mists wrapped the
glorious vision away even
before it had begun to fade.
We remained afloat on the
calm water, wondering at
the utter silence all around.
Not a breath of air stirred,
no stone fell, no avalanche
slipped. The babbling
glacier-torrent above alone
broke the evening stillness.</p>

</div>

<p>Next day we landed to
reconnoitre, and at two
o'clock the following morning we set forth
for our climb. We landed at the edge of a
forest and had to force our way through it. The
ground was a chaos of stones, the trees grew
close together and were densely matted with
other vegetation. The whole place was reeking
wet and it was pitch-dark. We fought and
tumbled our way through this hideous chaos as
best we might, and in an hour or two got out
on the other side, near the margin of a glacier.
Here we could scramble along well enough over
the moraine, and presently we had daylight to
help us. Nothing was visible ahead; there was
the ice-wall on one hand, rock-cliffs on the other.
Presently it seemed better to climb the rocks,
and we accordingly turned aside to scale them.
They were not difficult, and we rose higher
and higher, passing through another narrow belt
of forest, where the trees grew in the chinks
and crannies of a wall of rock polished by ice
and precipitously steep. Above that came a
floundering bog, and then at last a reasonable
grass-slope that narrowed into a rock-ridge.
The rock presently gave place in turn to snow,
and led us on to the mass of the mountain.</p>

<p>The weather was now tolerably clear, though
over all there hung a dark pall of cloud, through
occasional holes in which shafts of solid-looking
sunlight penetrated. Where we rested for breakfast
we had a most striking view over desolate
channels and still more desolate islands, a very
labyrinth of waterways and mountain walls. We
could see westwards to the ocean and northwards
to the continent; the flat land of the
northern part of Tierra del Fuego was at our
feet.</p>

<p>Its great mountain backbone was behind us
as we faced north. We looked along the face of
it as along a wall, but all its crest was in the
clouds. Looking down whence we had come
we saw our boat like a little cork on the
water. Also we could now look down into the
water itself and discover the countless sunken
rocks amongst which we had so casually navigated.
There was one, only a short distance
from our anchorage, close to which we must
have steamed. These details, of course, are not
charted; a navigator in such out-of-the-way
places must take his luck.</p>

<p>From this point our way lay right up the
great northern face of the peak, which is covered
by an ice-cascade. This empties below into a
huge glacier plateau or lake, which is drained
by several glacier tongues, up one of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
we had come. As we climbed on I kept
looking round and gazing on the wonderful
panorama, for it was obviously destined to be
soon blotted out. Our way lay amongst huge
seracs. Deep crevasses yawned all about, and
occasionally we had to double back and forth to
get ahead.</p>

<p>At last, however, we reached plainer going,
traversing a steeper but less broken slope
which led to the foot of a final pyramid of rock.
But these rocks, unfortunately, we never actually
reached, for the storm battalions from the north
swept furiously down upon us, swallowing up
the view before ever we reached the crest of the
range whence we might have looked down into
the dark hollow of Beagle Channel. The darkness
in the north before the tempest fell upon us
was truly appalling. As it advanced it seemed
to devour the wintry world. The heavens
appeared to be descending in solid masses, so
thick were the skirts of snow and hail that the
advancing cloud-phalanx trailed beneath it.
The black islands, the leaden waters, the pallid
snows, and the splintered ice-encrusted peaks
disappeared in the blackness of the storm, which
enveloped us also, almost before we had realized
that it was at hand. A sudden wind shrieked
and whirled round our heads; hail was flung
into our faces, and all the elements began to
rage together. The ice-plastered rocks were now
easily accounted for; we resembled them ourselves
in a very few minutes. All landmarks
vanished; the drifted snow itself was no longer
distinguishable from the snow-filled air.</p>

<p>To advance under these appalling conditions
was impossible. The one thing to be done,
and done at once, was to secure our retreat
before it was too late. How we raced downwards!
Not till we gained the lower glacier
did snow give place to rain, which soaked us to
the skin and overflowed in a steady stream out
of our boots. We floundered in swamps,
tumbled through brushwood, and at last gained
the shore, almost dead beat with toil, yet
delighting in what had been, after all, an
exhilarating experience. A boat came off to
fetch us, and we were soon on board our
steamer. Thus we did not reach the actual
summit of Mount Sarmiento&mdash;that remains
virgin, for I could not wait to try it again.
Whoever climbs it will accomplish a great feat
and will have a splendid experience. Some
years have already passed since my attempt,
however, and I have not heard of another. I
suppose the inhabitants of Sandy Point have
more urgent interests to attend to.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Told by "Cecil Addington" and Set Down by George A. Raper.</span>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A remarkable drama of modern life, showing the pitfalls that lie in wait for well-connected and
inexperienced young men, and that even to-day, in the heart of London, a man may go in peril
of his life. For obvious reasons the names of the people concerned have been changed, but the
correct names of all the parties have been supplied to us in confidence.</p></div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i0044dc.jpg" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">I write</span> this record of a strange
chapter in my life with a double
motive. It may serve, firstly, as a
warning to others who find themselves
placed in what I once regarded
as my enviable position. Secondly, it ought to
have a wider usefulness in opening people's eyes
to the very real dangers that lurk under the
surface of London life. Had anyone told me,
two years ago, that a man living in peaceful
England could be in daily danger of assassination
at the hands of an organized gang of
villains, I should have found no words strong
enough to express my disbelief. Still less would
I have supposed that I, Cecil Addington, a
strong, vigorous young Englishman, would ever
go about in constant dread of murderous
violence. Many who read my story will treat it
as the outcome of a disordered imagination and
refuse to believe that the forces of civilization
are powerless to protect a man whose death has
been deliberately planned. I wish I could share
this belief; but, unfortunately, my experience
points the other way. I have come to know
that there are to-day, in London, men who would
not hesitate to commit murder if it could be
done without undue risk to themselves, and who
have enough devilish ingenuity to reduce that
risk almost to vanishing-point.</p>

<p>But I had better begin at the beginning and
tell my story simply and straightforwardly, just
as it happened, merely warning the reader that,
though I am relating actual facts, I have, for
obvious reasons, used fictitious names.</p>

<p>In May, 1906, having got away from Cambridge
for a few days, I was enjoying myself in
town. I was doing it in a very small way and
under a sense of injustice, for I had nothing like
the means at my disposal that I considered my
due. In six months' time, on reaching my
majority, I was to come into possession of
thirty thousand pounds under my mother's will,
and yet I had still to get along as best I might
on a poor undergraduate's allowance from my
father. He and I did not hit it off at all well.
I was rather stage-struck, and had made up
my mind that an actor's life was the life
for me. He did not see it in that light,
and was dead set on getting me into the
Foreign Office, where, he argued, I could
use my money and 'Varsity education to some
purpose. If I had not been rather "green,"
and, I may as well admit, headstrong, I might
have seen that he was right. Anyhow, we
quarrelled, and he decided that, though he could
not prevent me from committing what he called
social suicide when I became my own master,
he would at any rate put the financial screw on
as long as he could. The result was that I
found myself tied down to the smallest possible
allowance, continued only on condition that I
remained at Cambridge. I was plainly told,
moreover, that if I were fool enough to throw up
everything and go on the stage, I should have
to exist as best I could. This gave me "furiously
to think," as they say in France. I had sense
enough to realize that budding actors do not fall
on their feet at once, and that I should very
likely be most unpleasantly hard up long before
the blessed day came when I could open a bank
account of my own. At the same time I was
irritated at being kept in leading-strings, and my
greatest desire was to find some way of circumventing
my cautious parent.</p>

<p>In this frame of mind I set off to London
one Friday to spend a week-end and a few
pounds I happened to have in hand. Archie
Hunter, one of my college chums, who was to
have gone with me, managed to sprain his ankle
the day before and had to stay indoors. I was
half inclined  to give up the expedition, but,
chafing as I was under a sense of restraint, it
seemed feeble to let my plans fall through on
account of an absurd accident, and it was with
a secret feeling of satisfaction at my own
determination that I got out of the train at
King's Cross, though I was beginning to feel
that I might not enjoy myself so very much,
after all, without a comrade.</p>

<p>I spent most of the afternoon hunting up
fellows of my acquaintance in the West-end,
and not finding them. Not knowing how to fill
up the interval before dinner, I dropped into a
well-known restaurant and sought solace in a
whisky and soda and a cigarette. There were
very few people in the bar&mdash;only a knot of two
or three men discussing racing&mdash;and I sat,
feeling a trifle lonely and not anticipating much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
fun for the evening. While I was cogitating the
door opened and a well-dressed man came in.
At the first glance I took him to be a retired
Army officer. His hair and moustache were
iron-grey, and, though he might have been well
on the wrong side of forty, he looked every bit
as active and supple as myself. His features
were remarkably handsome, and he had an
unmistakable air of good breeding, combined
with the easy bearing of an experienced
man of the world; in fact, he was just
such a type as youngsters like myself secretly
envy and take as their model. He glanced
carelessly at me as he came in, ordered a whisky
and soda, and, standing near me at the bar, took
a long pull at
his drink, after
which he reached
over the bar to
take a match.
As he did so his
arm touched my
glass and overturned
it.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 562px;">
<img src="images/i0045.jpg" width="562" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"HIS ARM TOUCHED MY GLASS AND OVERTURNED IT."</p></div>
</div>

<p>He was profuse
in his
apologies.</p>

<p>"How awfully
careless of me!"
he exclaimed.
"I am so sorry.
Hope I haven't
spilt any of the
stuff over your
clothes?"</p>

<p>I answered
that it was not
of the slightest
consequence,
but he continued
to excuse himself,
and insisted
on having my
glass refilled, in
spite of my
protests. In
another two
minutes we were
chatting away as
if we had known
each other for
years. My new
friend proved a
delightful companion.
He
seemed to have
been everywhere
worth mentioning
and to know
all sorts of celebrities. He had a way of keeping
the talk on the subjects which most interested
me, and I felt a secret satisfaction at talking on
equal terms with a man so much older and
cleverer than myself. Although I did not realize
it at the time, he was one of those accomplished
conversationalists who do not appear to be
saying much, but manage to make the other
fellows think they can talk rather well. He
soon found out that I was a Cambridge man,
and as he turned out to be an old Cantab himself,
that was another bond of union between
us. We exchanged cards, and I found that his
bore the name of "Captain Wyngate."</p>

<p>We got on so uncommonly well together that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
I was quite annoyed to find it was half-past
seven, and that I should soon have to think
about my solitary dinner.</p>

<p>As if divining my thoughts, my new acquaintance
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What are you going to do this evening?"</p>

<p>I had to admit, rather against my will, that I
had no particular plans and did not know what
to do with myself.</p>

<p>"You had better come and dine with me," he
said. "I haven't anything on to-night, and we
might just as well have a bit of dinner together
and go somewhere afterwards, if you feel
inclined."</p>

<p>The invitation was given so frankly and
cordially that I accepted it without any fuss,
being only too glad of the prospect of a cheerful
evening instead of mooning about by myself.
It never occurred to me that I knew nothing
whatever about Captain Wyngate, and that he
might not prove so reputable an acquaintance
as he looked.</p>

<p>We took a cab and drove to a queer little
French restaurant, quite unlike anything I had
ever seen, in a back street in Soho. In a
general way I regarded the typical London
restaurant as a big, showy establishment, with a
profusion of electric lights, flowers on the
tables, and everyone in evening dress. The
place chosen by Captain Wyngate was entirely
different. It was up two pairs of very narrow
stairs covered with a red carpet, and seemed to
be made up of quite poky little rooms. We
were shown into one containing only a small
table set for two, a sideboard, and a sofa.</p>

<p>"They seem to be expecting us," I remarked,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, they know my ways here," Wyngate
replied, as he proceeded to question the waiter
in French, which was a good deal too fluent for
me to follow.</p>

<p>There was a surprisingly elaborate menu for
such a little hole of a place, and it was with feelings
of considerable satisfaction that I plunged into the
dinner. It was admirably cooked and beautifully
served&mdash;in fact, it was about the best dinner I
had ever tasted; and by the time I had absorbed
my second glass of Burgundy I was feeling particularly
well-disposed towards humanity in
general and my host in particular. Without
seeming to question me at all, he showed such a
friendly interest in me that the champagne found
us on quite an intimate footing. Before the
coffee and cigars came, and the waiter had
left us alone, Captain Wyngate knew all about me,
and I had a strong impression that he was preordained
to be my guide, philosopher, and friend.</p>

<p>When I bemoaned my fate at being kept on
short commons until I came of age, he smiled.</p>

<p>"You needn't unless you like," he said.</p>

<p>"I've heard of fellows borrowing on their
expectations," I replied; "but it costs a lot,
doesn't it? And I don't know anything about
that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's simple enough," he remarked,
casually, flicking the ash off his cigar.</p>

<p>"I might get into some old Jew's clutches,"
I remarked.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," he replied, "all those
stories about modern Shylocks are rubbish. You
must have been reading about the man in Balzac
who was fool enough to take a bit in cash and
the rest in stuffed crocodiles. All that sort of
thing is over now, and if you have anything
solid in the way of expectations you can always
raise money on them from reliable people."</p>

<p>Then, as if the subject did not interest him,
he began to talk about something else; but he
had set me thinking. Half-a-dozen times at
least I was on the point of asking him to help
me, but I did not want him to think me hopelessly
inexperienced in business matters. At
length I said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you know, I have been thinking of
raising a little money, and now that I am in
town I might as well see about it."</p>

<p>"If you have made up your mind," he said,
"there is no use in losing time. To whom do
you intend to go?"</p>

<p>This was a poser. I had the vaguest
possible ideas about money-lenders, and did
not know the name of a single member of the
fraternity.</p>

<p>Before I could find an answer he observed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There's Jackson, in X&mdash;&mdash; Street. Why not try him?
I haven't had to visit him myself,
but I know about him, and I will go and see
him with you if you like."</p>

<p>"That would be awfully kind of you," I said,
gratefully.</p>

<p>"Of course," he added, "it's of no use unless
you can tell him something definite about the
property. He doesn't care about wasting time
on little bits of business, and I suppose you
would like to have a good pocketful of money."</p>

<p>I replied by giving him all the information I
had about my expectations. He listened attentively,
asked two or three questions, said he did
not think there would be any difficulty, and
made an appointment for us to meet the
following morning. This done, he called for
the waiter, paid the bill, and we spent the rest
of the evening at a music-hall. I returned to
my hotel charmed with my new acquaintance,
and feeling a warm glow of satisfaction at the
thought that in a few days I should have as
much as I wanted to spend instead of having to
reckon with every shilling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>Next morning, Saturday, I woke in my little
sixth-floor bedroom to see the sun shining
brilliantly, and it was in excellent spirits that I
dressed and went down to breakfast. As usual
in the season, the hotel was full, and few seats
were vacant in the lofty and lavishly-decorated
hall, still called, by virtue of old custom, the
coffee-room. The cheerful hum of conversation,
the noiseless dexterity of the waiters darting to
and fro, the comfort and luxury of the surroundings,
increased my sense of enjoyment,
and while waiting for my coffee and kidneys I
began to think what an uncommonly good time
I might have in London. What a fool I had
been not to think of raising money before! It
must be simple enough, judging by what Captain
Wyngate had said, and he seemed to know
pretty well what he was talking about.</p>

<p>I had barely finished breakfast when the
captain himself came into the coffee-room, much
to my surprise. He explained that he had some
business near my hotel, and that he had dropped
in on the chance of finding me, so that we
could go to X&mdash;&mdash; Street together, instead of
meeting as we had originally planned. I was
afraid he had put himself out of his way for my
convenience, but this he would not admit, and
I had to put down his visit as another proof
of his obliging disposition. Off we went in a
hansom to X&mdash;&mdash; Street, and were lucky enough
to find Jackson disengaged.</p>

<p>He was not at all the type of man I had
expected to see. I had imagined a rather
grimy and snuffy-looking individual, sitting in a
little, dark room, surrounded by safes and deed-boxes.
Mr. Jackson, on the other hand, was
quite a gentleman: tall, well-groomed, clean-shaven,
and wearing an immaculate frock-coat.
Captain Wyngate was kind enough to explain
why I had come. After this he got up and was
about to leave the room, and I had some difficulty
in getting him to stay and help me out.
This was lucky, as Jackson proved a hard nut to
crack. He was very polite, but raised so many
objections that I began to despair of doing
anything with him. It was very risky, he said,
to lend money to minors, as he knew to his cost;
and then, how was he to be sure I was to get as
much as thirty thousand pounds? Trusts did
not always produce what was expected of
them. Finally, after asking a lot of questions
about my family and the date of the will, he
promised to make inquiries and give me an
answer at three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Had I known more about business it would
probably have struck me as peculiar that a few
hours should be considered enough to investigate
a transaction of which the lender was supposed
to know next to nothing. In the light of
subsequent knowledge I am convinced that the
urbane Mr. Jackson knew all about the matter
long before he set eyes on me, and that the
postponement until the afternoon was a mere
blind. In happy unconsciousness of this I
accepted an invitation to luncheon from Captain
Wyngate, who kindly expressed his intention of
seeing me through the business. And a very
excellent lunch it was, too&mdash;just the kind of
thing to make a man feel at peace with himself
and all the world. Three o'clock saw us back
at Jackson's office.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Addington," he said, "I have
looked into the matter, and I think I shall be
able to accommodate you."</p>

<p>"I'm very glad to hear it," I returned,
joyously.</p>

<p>"Of course, I need not tell anyone of your
intelligence and education," he continued, "that
this is a rather irregular sort of transaction, and
very risky for me. If you were to take advantage
of being a minor and should go back on
your word, where should I be?"</p>

<p>I assured him there was no danger of anything
of the kind happening.</p>

<p>"I could not do business of this kind," he
continued, "with anyone who was not a gentleman,
and in whom I did not feel the fullest
confidence."</p>

<p>He said this so impressively that I was quite
touched&mdash;the champagne at luncheon was
certainly very good&mdash;and inwardly decided that
a money-lender was just as likely as anyone else
to be a good fellow.</p>

<p>"But," he continued, "you must remember
the risk, as I said before, and that I have heavy
expenses (he didn't mention what they were),
but I will advance you five thousand pounds on
the spot, if you will undertake to repay me eight
thousand pounds when you come of age. The
only other condition that I make is that you
insure your life in my favour, so that in case
anything happened to you I should not lose my
money."</p>

<p>This proposal rather took my breath away,
and I stared at him blankly.</p>

<p>"I can assure you," he said, with a bland
smile, "that these are really very favourable
terms. Plenty of other gentlemen in my line
would refuse to take the risk at any price.
Perhaps you would like to talk it over with this
gentleman?" indicating Captain Wyngate.</p>

<p>Without waiting for an answer, he rose and
left the room. I cast an appealing glance at the
captain.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," he said, "you mustn't
think that I want to advise you against your
own interests, but you might do worse than take
this offer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Three thousand pounds is a lot of interest,"
I urged.</p>

<p>"It's only a small slice out of your thirty
thousand," he replied, shrugging his shoulders.
"Jackson treats you like a gentleman, and will
hand the money over at once. If you go to someone
else you may be kept hanging on for weeks
and charged all sorts of fees and expenses."</p>

<p>"All the same&mdash;&mdash;" I began.</p>

<p>"What's the use of haggling about a hundred
or two?" Wyngate interrupted. "You won't
save anything in the long run."</p>

<p>His tone and look implied that he considered
I was trying to drive a hard bargain. To be
thought mean by this superior being, who had
shown himself so friendly and hospitable, was
more than I could endure, and I hastily replied
that he was quite right, and that we might as
well settle the affair at once.</p>

<p>Jackson opportunely returning at this juncture,
I signified my acceptance of his terms. A bond
and an insurance proposal which had been made
out beforehand were produced, and I signed
them.</p>

<p>"Shall I cross the cheque for payment
through your own bank, Mr. Addington?"
Jackson asked, bringing out his cheque-book.
"But perhaps," he added, before I had to
confess that I had no banking account, "you
would prefer to have part of the money in cash.
A thousand pounds in notes and the rest in a
cheque? Certainly. If you will kindly count
the notes in this bundle, I think you will find
them all right. Thank you, Mr. Addington.
My clerk will call upon you with any other
papers there may be for you to sign."</p>

<p>I walked out with the money in my pocket
and my troubles before me.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My doings during the next few weeks were
not exactly what might be called judicious, but
what can be expected from a youth suddenly
let loose in London with heaps of money and
nobody to restrain him? I am quite willing to
admit that I was a fool, but I dare say a great
many other people would not have proved much
wiser if they had found themselves in similar
circumstances. Without suspecting it, I was a
sort of Faust in the clutches of a modern
Mephistopheles. As Captain Wyngate had
given me the Open Sesame, he naturally stepped
into the position of familiar friend and adviser.
Of course, Cambridge saw me no more. I took
up my abode in furnished rooms close to Piccadilly,
and was delighted when Captain Wyngate
accepted an invitation to leave his hotel and
share my quarters. Under his guidance I began
to enjoy myself exceedingly. The gaps in my
knowledge of the Metropolis filled up very
quickly, and I think I could pass a pretty stiff
examination about the places of amusement,
recognised and unrecognised, in London.
Wyngate and I were constantly together, and
he introduced me to a good many men who
seemed, like himself, to have no particular
occupation except killing time as agreeably as
possible. He generally picked up these acquaintances
on race-courses, in hotel bars, music-halls,
and other public places. We did not go to any
private houses. Captain Wyngate voted dances
slow, and I was enjoying myself so much under
his guidance that I was not inclined to differ
from him.</p>

<p>In the enclosure at Kempton Park he introduced
me to a strikingly handsome and stylish
young lady, Miss Violet Alexander, and took
the earliest opportunity of telling me in a confidential
whisper that she was an actress and
immensely clever. Both these statements I
afterwards found to be true in a sense; I did
not understand at the time. She was extremely
gracious, and I was much flattered when she
invited me to take a cup of tea with her at her
flat in Bedford Park. She soon fascinated me
completely, and after my second visit I was
madly in love, or thought I was. Captain
Wyngate, to whose experience I resorted as a
matter of course, suggested that a handsome present
would advance matters very materially. He
kindly undertook to find out from the lady what
would be most acceptable to her, and the result
was the transfer of a lace dress and a diamond
star to Miss Violet's abode, and a hole of seven
hundred pounds in my bank account. Both
these presents were purchased (very much above
their real value, as I afterwards found out) at
shops recommended by Captain Wyngate, on
the ground that they were "the" place for such
things, and that gifts were always more appreciated
when the lady knew they came from the
very best places. My gifts certainly did not
disgrace even the wardrobe of Miss Violet
Alexander. They made her even more gracious
than before, and but for the rude awakening
that came soon afterwards there is no knowing
what further follies she would have made me
commit.</p>

<p>One night, when we were to have gone to a
new play at the Gaiety, the captain felt out of
sorts and decided to stay indoors with a book
and a pipe. I returned home rather late, and,
as I passed his room, I heard choking, inarticulate
sounds. Thinking he must be ill, I opened
the door quietly and looked in. He was lying
in bed, tossing uneasily and muttering in his
sleep. While I waited&mdash;wondering if I ought
to wake him&mdash;his muttering went on, broken
here and there by an intelligible word.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"'HANDS OFF!' HE ALMOST SHOUTED, AND STARTED UP IN BED."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"The Rigi&mdash;Came
for your
health&mdash;Hate
looking over precipices,
do you?&mdash;Oh,
don't be a
baby!&mdash;Two thousand
feet down&mdash;Ah,
I've done it!"</p>

<p>Beads of perspiration
started
out on his forehead,
and he
groaned as if
suffering agonies.</p>

<p>I put my hand
on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Hands off!"
he almost shouted,
and started up in
bed, a horrible
expression of fear
on his face.</p>

<p>"Why, Wyngate,
old chap,
you seem to be
having a first-class
nightmare," I
remarked.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you,
is it?" he replied,
not very graciously.
"What are you
doing here?"</p>

<p>"You were talking
in your sleep,"
I told him, "and
tossing about all
over the place."</p>

<p>"That's very
strange indeed,"
he said, anxiously.
"I'm seldom troubled with nightmares."</p>

<p>"Yes," I continued, "you thought you were
at the top of a precipice in Switzerland with
another fellow, and threw him over."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" he exclaimed, roughly.</p>

<p>"Weren't you dreaming about precipices?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind!" he snapped. "I
have slept badly, that was all, and you needn't
have roused me."</p>

<p>"Sorry, old chap," I rejoined, and left the
room, rather offended by his unusual surliness.</p>

<p>Next morning Wyngate said nothing about
his nightmare, but the effects did not seem to
have left him. He found fault with the breakfast,
made irritable remarks, and, though he was
not actually rude, revealed a side of his
character which was new to me. This was, in
fact, the commencement of altered relations
between us. I began to notice in his conversation
covert sneers at my youth and inexperience,
though this did not in the least prevent
him from borrowing a few pounds from time to
time when a bill came in. The money would
not have mattered at all had he remained the
good fellow he had seemed at first, but it was a
different matter now, and I began to chafe.</p>

<p>Things went on like this for a couple of
weeks. Then one day Hicks, my servant, came
to me with three of Captain Wyngate's tradesmen's
bills.</p>

<p>"The captain," said Hicks, "won't be back
till to-night, sir, and he told me to ask you if
you would kindly pay these for him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>This was the last straw. To be sneered at
by a man who was living under my roof, and
then to be expected to pay his tailor and bootmaker,
was more than I could stand. With as
much composure as I could command, I told
Hicks that Captain Wyngate would settle the
accounts when he returned. I then sat down
and wrote my guest a note, in which I told him
what I thought of him, and added that, as he
would probably prefer other quarters, Hicks
would pack up his things as soon as he pleased.
After this I went out, spent the afternoon watching
a cricket match at Lord's, and did not
return home until late, when, to my great relief,
Captain Wyngate's room was vacant.</p>

<p>"What did the captain say when he read my
note?" I asked Hicks.</p>

<p>"He only laughed, sir," was the reply, "and
said he was going away for a change of air."</p>

<p>It was a relief to find that my Old Man of the
Sea, as I had now come to regard the fascinating
captain, had been unseated so easily, and
I went to bed feeling decidedly pleased with
myself, and quite convinced that I had heard
the last of him. This fond delusion, however,
was shattered the very next day by the arrival of
a crop of his bills, including those of the day
before, all brought by men with instructions to
ask for payment. I was for indignantly repudiating
all liabilities, but Hicks deferentially
suggested that this might create a bad impression;
and on reflection I saw that a blunt
refusal might bring some of my own creditors
about my ears rather sooner than I had bargained
for. I therefore told Hicks to say the accounts
would be settled next day, and meanwhile sent
him to the hotel at which Captain Wyngate was
staying before he joined me, with a chillingly
polite note requesting him to settle with his
tradespeople. Hicks came back with the
cheerful information that the captain had
gone away and left no address. Not knowing
what else to do, I paid. The amount was not
large&mdash;some fifty pounds, in fact&mdash;but signing
the cheques was a very bitter pill.</p>

<p>Being now left to my own resources, it
occurred to me to look into my finances, and I
discovered to my amazement that I had run
through more than four thousand pounds in
two months! There were also accounts owing,
and it dawned upon me that at my present rate
of living I should be without a penny long before
my twenty-first birthday arrived.</p>

<p>"Bah!" I said to myself. "I can always
borrow again if I run short." And I tried to
dismiss the matter from my mind. I suppose,
though, there must have been a thin strain of
caution, probably inherited from a Scotch grandfather,
underneath my foolishness, for I could
not shake off a feeling that I was drifting on to
the rocks. I went to see Violet Alexander, with
a vague hope of getting sympathy, but was told
she had gone out. I called again and again,
with the same result. Could it be that she did
not want to see me?</p>

<p>In this position, ashamed to make it up with
my father, and not having a single friend to
whom I cared to turn, I did what I ought to
have done long ago. I went to Lincoln's Inn
Fields to lay my case before the family solicitors.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Mr. Benedict is away, sir, but his son, Mr.
Charles, will see you," was the reply to the
announcement of my name, and I was ushered
into the presence of Mr. Charles Benedict. He
did not correspond at all to my idea of a family
solicitor. He was faultlessly dressed, and did
not look much older than myself, but it did not
take me long to discover that his knowledge of
town was as extensive and peculiar as Mr.
Weller's.</p>

<p>"Ah! Captain Wyngate," he repeated, when I
mentioned the name of my evil genius. "Tall,
fine-looking man, with a grey moustache, isn't
he?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, in surprise. "Do you know
him?"</p>

<p>"I should say that he was pretty well known,"
rejoined Mr. Charles Benedict, with a smile.
"But perhaps you had better go on with your
story."</p>

<p>Encouraged by his interest in my troubles, I
went ahead and gave him the main lines of the
narrative, though I could not yet bring myself
to disclose all the details of my weakness. When
I had answered his last question he drew a long
breath and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Addington, I congratulate you!"</p>

<p>"What about?" I asked. "It seems to me
I am in a pretty bad mess."</p>

<p>"So you are," he replied, cheerfully. "But I
was congratulating you on coming to us before
it was too late. You have had a narrow escape.
Did you never suspect what kind of man Captain
Wyngate is?"</p>

<p>"Not until those bills came in," I replied.</p>

<p>"The bills," remarked Mr. Benedict, "are a
mere trifle. Captain Wyngate is one of the most
dangerous men in London. The police have
had their eye upon him for years, but he is so
clever that they have never been able to catch
him in the act. He lives on inexperienced
young men with money."</p>

<p>"Like me, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but you are not the first by a very long
way. Your case is quite in his best style. He
has goodness knows how many accomplices,
quite a syndicate of sharks, and they have all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
sorts of shady people in their pay. I have no
doubt whatever that he knew all about your
money affairs and had a look at you at
Cambridge without your knowledge; also that
he knew of your coming to London and had
you tracked to the bar where he made your
acquaintance by upsetting your glass. Jackson
is in the syndicate, and you may be sure our
friend the captain would have had a good slice
out of the three thousand pounds they reckoned
to make out of you; but I think we can stop
their little game."</p>

<p>Needless to say, these disclosures staggered
me considerably.</p>

<p>"Then Captain Wyngate is nothing but a
swindler?" I asked.</p>

<p>"One of the worst type," answered the solicitor.
"I don't think he would stick at murder
if it was worth while and could be done safely.
He was mixed up in the death of Charlie
Byfleet, a rich young fellow who went to
Switzerland with him and was killed by falling
down a precipice. Many people suspected that
Wyngate got possession of Byfleet's money and
papers and then pushed him over the cliff."</p>

<p>"That explains the nightmare!" I exclaimed,
and I told my adviser of the scene in Wyngate's
bedroom.</p>

<p>"Yes; no doubt he has to do it over again in
his sleep now and then," said Mr. Benedict,
"but that's all the punishment he has had. He
swore it was an accident, and there was no
evidence against him. He has been keeping
quiet since that affair, but he must have thought
it had blown over by this time as he has begun
again on you. I suppose he kept you to himself
as long as he could?"</p>

<p>"He never took me to see anybody except
Violet Alexander, the actress," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" ejaculated Mr. Benedict,
smiling. "This is interesting. Did you find
her very agreeable?"</p>

<p>"Charming," I replied, ingenuously.</p>

<p>"Wasn't she a rather expensive acquaintance?"</p>

<p>I was obliged to confess that she was, and
mentioned the presents.</p>

<p>"Of course, as you were so friendly with
Wyngate, you had to be nice to his wife,"
observed the solicitor.</p>

<p>"<em>What?</em>" I exclaimed, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"She is a very useful helpmate for him,"
continued the lawyer, smiling compassionately
at me. "They have hunted together for years
and made lots of money. Have you never
heard of Violet Alexander's solid silver bath?
You may be quite sure the lace dress and the
diamond star have gone back to the shops where
Wyngate made you buy them, and that he and
Violet pocketed a nice little commission on the
transaction. The shopkeepers are just as much
in the gang as Wyngate and Jackson are.
Wyngate stayed with you until he saw you were
getting restive; then he ran up a few bills for
you to pay and cleared out. You will not see
him again until Jackson's bill falls due."</p>

<p>"And then?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Then there will be ructions," said Mr.
Benedict, cheerfully.</p>

<p>Here he took up a paper-knife, played with it
carelessly, and looked as if he expected me to
find a way out of the tangle.</p>

<p>"Great Scot!" I exclaimed. "Shall I have
to pay these villains eight thousand pounds?"</p>

<p>"You certainly would if you had not come to
us in time," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Then I am in time?" I asked, much
relieved.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Benedict; "we can save your
money, if you hand it over to someone else."</p>

<p>"What on earth do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Simply this. You must execute a deed
placing your property, from the moment you
become entitled to it, in the hands of trustees,
who will pay you, let us say, three or four
hundred a year out of the income. You will be
unable to touch the capital. When Mr. Jackson
presents his little bill, you refer him to your
trustees, who will repay him his five thousand
pounds with strict legal interest. Come back
next week, and we will have the papers ready
for you to sign. In the meantime I recommend
you to change your quarters or leave London
altogether."</p>

<p>I left Mr. Benedict with a new respect for the
legal profession. After having been so thoroughly
fooled and exploited, it was pleasant to think
that I should have the laugh on my side in the
long run. I was not at all inclined to keep out
of the way, however. To miss the <em>d&eacute;nouement</em>
was not to be thought of; but I decided to
retire to less expensive rooms, settle my outstanding
debts, dispense with Hicks ("I suppose
he makes commissions out of me, like the rest
of them," I said to myself, savagely), and await
the crisis.</p>

<p>The rest of the summer and the early part
of the autumn I spent very agreeably in the
country, returning to London a few days before
my twenty-first birthday, which fell on November
15th. I took care to write Jackson a polite
letter, informing him of my change of address,
and received an equally polite acknowledgment,
to my great delight. In due course came
another letter, reminding me that it would give
Mr. Jackson pleasure to receive the sum of
eight thousand pounds at my earliest convenience.
This letter I handed over to Mr.
Benedict, who, in the best legal language,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
replied that he and his father, as my sole
trustees, repudiated the transactions I had
entered into, but would nevertheless repay the
five thousand pounds, with six months' interest
at four per cent.</p>

<p>I would have given a good deal to see the
faces of Jackson and Co. when they received
this missive. By what I could gather from my
lawyers, the money-lender was very indignant at
first, but when he found he could make no impression
on the Benedicts he concluded to treat
the matter as one of those little disappointments
to which business men are liable; and, finally,
he accepted the offer and the money. I had
expected him to show more fight, and was
rather disappointed at first; but I had not long
to wait for excitement.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Late one afternoon I was on my way home to
dress for dinner, after spending an hour or two
at one of my usual resorts near the Strand.
Having plenty of time, I turned into the Green
Park and was sauntering along, enjoying a
cigarette, when a hand was laid on my shoulder
from behind, and a well-known voice exclaimed:
"A word with you, my friend!"</p>

<p>It was Captain Wyngate!</p>

<p>I wheeled round and looked at him defiantly.</p>

<p>"I have nothing to say to you," I said, curtly.</p>

<p>"But I have a great deal to say to you," he
retorted. "I have been on the look-out for you
for some time, and now that there is no one to
listen to us I would like to give you a small
piece of advice."</p>

<p>"I don't want it," I interrupted.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," he continued; "but if you
don't take it you will be very sorry one of these
days. Are you going to pay Jackson his three
thousand pounds or are you not?"</p>

<p>His manner was brusque and overbearing to
the last degree, and my temper began to rise.</p>

<p>"What has that to do with you?" I
demanded.</p>

<p>"That's my affair," he snapped. "Make
your trustees pay up, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or what?"</p>

<p>"You'll see, and pretty soon, too."</p>

<p>"Look here, Captain Wyngate," I exclaimed,
hotly, "I am not going to be bullied. You and
your friends have had all you will get out of
me. I know you to be one of the biggest
scoundrels in London, and if you interfere with
me, look out for yourself, that's all."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" he sneered. "So you think you
can trick me and get off scot-free, do you?
Listen! If that money isn't paid in a week I'll
have your life!"</p>

<p>"Don't talk rubbish," I interposed.</p>

<p>"Ah, you think yourself safe," he went on, in
the same ironical tone. "You imagine the
police will protect you, I suppose. You young
idiot, your life won't be worth sixpence!"</p>

<p>"Touch me if you dare!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're quite safe now," he sneered.
"I give you a week to think it over, and then,
if the money isn't paid, look out. You have
had fair warning."</p>

<p>"More than the man in Switzerland had," I
suggested sarcastically, as Wyngate turned away.</p>

<p>He gave me one look of concentrated hate,
and seemed about to speak, but checked himself,
turned his back on me, and disappeared
in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Bluff!" I said to myself. "What can he
do?" And I continued my walk home.</p>

<p>I was quite as strong as Wyngate, and felt
well able to hold my own if he attacked me.
As to the idea of being murdered in the heart
of London, it was preposterous. This kind of
thing might happen among secret society men
and weird foreigners handy with their knives;
but Englishmen had nothing to fear, I assured
myself, and several fellows to whom I mentioned
the matter casually at the club agreed with me.
I did not even think it worth while to tell Mr.
Benedict of the meeting.</p>

<p>One night I was walking home through a fog
which, though not possessing the regulation pea-soup
consistency, was thick enough to make it
impossible to see anyone more than twenty yards
away. As I entered St. James's Square I heard
footsteps behind me, but having no thought of
danger I paid no attention to them. Suddenly
I felt a violent blow on the shoulder, and turning
sharply round I saw a man with an uplifted
bludgeon, in the act of striking at me again. I
was absolutely defenceless, having not even a
cane with me. The thought, "Wyngate's at
the bottom of this!" flashed across my mind. I
had just time to jump aside and avoid the stick
as it fell. Then I dashed off at full speed into
the fog. I was at too great a disadvantage to be
heroic.</p>

<p>My assailant made no attempt to follow me.
His coup having failed, he no doubt thought it
prudent to clear out at once. I could not distinguish
his features, but one thing was certain:
he was not Wyngate. He was a rather short,
thick-set man, wearing a soft hat pulled well
down over his eyes. The only other detail that
struck me during the instant we were at close
quarters was the strong smell of drink which he
gave out. I put him down as a hired ruffian,
and it became evident to me that if Wyngate
were capable of using such instruments of
revenge I should have to take him a good deal
more seriously than hitherto.</p>

<p>As long as there was the bruise on my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
shoulder to remind me of the adventure in
St. James's Square I was almost prudent. I
took to carrying a sword-cane, and went home
at night in cabs instead of walking. I also gave
myself a certain amount of entertainment by
man&#339;uvering to find out whether I was being
followed. To this end I used to stop suddenly
and pretend to look into shop-windows, in the
hope of catching the spy unawares; but, if he
existed at all, he was cleverer than I at the
game. Nothing happened except a collision
now and then, caused by some innocent
promenader running into me from behind when
I pulled up. Then I had to apologize and try
not to look foolish.
Finally
my natural insouciance
got
the upper hand,
and I ceased to
worry about my
enemy.</p>

</div>

<p>Christmas was
drawing near,
and I was preparing
to leave
town to spend
the festive season
with friends
in the country,
when I received
a wire one morning
from Archie
Hunter, my
Cambridge
chum, telling me
he was coming
to town in the
afternoon, and
asking me to
meet him at six
o'clock in the
bar of a small
West-end hotel
where we had
foregathered on
previous occasions.
I was
on hand at the
appointed time,
but there was no
sign of Hunter.</p>

<p>"Train late,
I suppose," I
thought, and sat
down to wait.
There was no
one I knew in
the bar, but, being sociably inclined, I was
soon in conversation with two or three other
men whose only object seemed to be to while
away the time. With them were a couple of
fashionably-dressed girls, and by and by I
noticed that one of them looked at me frequently,
not as if she wanted to begin a flirtation,
but rather with curiosity. I had never
seen her before, but, beyond wondering vaguely
whether she had remarked something peculiar
about my appearance, I paid no attention,
engaged as I was in discussing cricket with one
of the men.</p>

<p>Presently two of them began to talk billiards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
at which, it seemed, they were old rivals, and,
as neither would admit inferiority, they decided
to go upstairs to the billiard-room and play a
couple of hundred up.</p>

<p>"We may as well go and watch them,"
remarked the man with whom I was talking.</p>

<p>"All right," I said, unsuspectingly, and,
emptying my glass, I prepared to go upstairs.</p>

<p>The billiard-players led the way, the others
following. The girl who had been looking at
me was the last except myself to leave the bar.
The door-handle apparently slipped from her
fingers and the door, which had an ordinary
spring, closed in her face with a slam, thus
momentarily cutting us off from the others. To
my intense surprise she turned and whispered,
hurriedly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't go upstairs; they will throw you down!"</p>

<p>In another instant she had pulled the door
open and was ascending the stairs.</p>

<p>"Wyngate again!" was the thought that
flashed through my mind.</p>

<p>At first I was inclined to disregard the warning,
but a moment's reflection showed me that
there was no disgrace in declining an unequal
combat, and that, even if I were not knocked
downstairs by some cleverly-contrived "accident,"
I could be sure of being dealt some underhand
blow by agents of so unscrupulous a person as
my late guest.</p>

<p>I went up three or four steps, and then&mdash;exclaiming,
"Forgotten my stick; I'll be back
in a moment!"&mdash;I returned to the bar, went
out quickly by another door, jumped into a
hansom, and made good my retreat.</p>

<p>"Two not out, captain!" I remarked, with
satisfaction; but, as I was soon to discover, the
game was not by any means finished.</p>

<p>I wrote to Hunter at once, asking him if he had
wired me to meet him. He replied that he had
not done so, and that someone must have been
using his name.</p>

<p>The more I thought over the situation the
less I liked it. It was evident that I had
become the object of a sort of vendetta on the
part of a very clever scoundrel, who would stick
at nothing to obtain his revenge and was always
ready to strike at me when I least expected it.
To apply to the police would have been useless,
as I had not a scrap of evidence against him. I
had slipped through his fingers twice, but I
could hardly count upon another such timely
warning as I received in the hotel bar. The
girl must have known that there was a plot
against me, but why did she interfere? Was it
caprice or a good instinct?</p>

<p>In the hope of finding out something I
dropped in two or three times at the hotel at
different hours, but the few guarded inquiries I
made led to nothing. The girl and her companions
were merely chance customers, quite
unknown to the hotel people, who would have
been almost as disagreeably surprised as myself
if Wyngate's little scheme had succeeded.</p>

<p>Feeling that the air of London was becoming
decidedly unwholesome, I went off to my friends
at Folkestone, rather unwisely leaving my
address, so that letters could be forwarded.
Thanks to cheerful surroundings&mdash;the society of
nice people has a really remarkable effect in
changing the current of one's ideas&mdash;my
enemy's sinister figure began to recede into the
background. I was one of a house-party of about
a dozen, and they were all intensely interested in
my story, though nobody could suggest anything
better than going abroad for a year or two.</p>

<p>On the Tuesday after my arrival somebody
mentioned that there was to be a ball on the
following Monday at one of the hotels on the
cliff, and we decided to make up a party and
go. Tickets were taken, and, of course, we
made no secret of our intention, which was
known to the servants, tradespeople, and, in
fact, anyone who might have taken an interest
in our doings.</p>

<p>On the Monday afternoon, while we were
talking and tea-drinking in the drawing-room,
Charlie Barbour, one of the party, came in,
walked straight up to me, and remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, old chap, there's some more fun in
store for you."</p>

<p>"What on earth do you mean?" I demanded,
vaguely uneasy.</p>

<p>"Only that your friend Wyngate is beginning
again," he replied.</p>

<p>Then he told us that, happening to stroll into
a barber's to get himself smartened up for the
evening, he had overheard two men talking confidentially
in German while waiting their turn
to be shaved. As it happened, Charlie was
educated in Germany, and understood the language
perfectly well. At first, having no desire
to overhear what was not intended for him, he
paid no attention, but presently he caught a
remark about the ball to which we were going
the same evening. Listening more attentively,
he made out that somebody at the ball was to
be given a letter asking him to come outside
for a few minutes on to the terrace at the top
of the cliff. This did not at first strike him as
suspicious, but when the two men, who looked
like innocent commercial travellers, had left the
shop it suddenly occurred to Charlie that their
conversation might relate to me. It was so
very much like Wyngate's style, he thought, to
get me on top of a cliff at night, when there
would probably be no one to see what happened
to me. With this idea in his head, Charlie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
escaped from the barber's as promptly as possible
and spent an hour or two prowling about
in search of the two men, but in vain; after
which he made for home to tell me his story.</p>

<p>The girls became very much excited, and one
of them said I was like the hero of a sensational
novel. We held a sort of council of war, and
decided that, if any letter of the kind were sent
in to me while the dance was going on, I should
go outside with a revolver in my pocket, and
that Barbour and another man, Carruthers, also
armed, should follow close behind.</p>

<p>We were still discussing the affair when a telegram
was brought to me. I opened it and read:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you value your life, leave Folkestone
immediately."</p>

<p>There was no signature, but I had not the
least doubt that the telegram, which came from
London, was sent by the unknown girl who had
already befriended me once.</p>

<p>Somebody remarked that the situation was
becoming quite dramatic. I agreed; but when
I asked whether anyone would like to take my
part as the hero there were no offers.</p>

<p>Calling in the police was suggested; but
Barbour and Carruthers&mdash;both strong, active
fellows&mdash;objected strongly to giving anyone
else a chance of capturing a brace of modern
desperadoes, and we concluded to keep the
matter perfectly quiet, so as to give the enemy
no hint of the counter-mine we were preparing.</p>

<p>I never went to such an exciting dance in my
life as I did that evening; and all the others in
our party were equally on the <i lang="fr">qui vive</i>. I rather
enjoyed it after a time, as the ladies were so very
anxious to keep me dancing with them; while
Barbour and Carruthers several times got into
trouble with their partners through trying to keep
their eye on me instead of attending to business.</p>

<p>It was nearly twelve o'clock before the
expected summons came. I had just taken my
partner back to her seat when one of the hotel
servants came and told me a gentleman was
anxious to see me outside on important business.</p>

<p>Signalling to Barbour and Carruthers, I left
the ball-room and strolled as unconcernedly as
possible out on to the terrace. There was no
moon, and, but for a few twinkling gas-lamps
and the light from the hotel windows, all was
dark outside. I could just distinguish two men
standing on the terrace about twenty yards away.
Seeing me walk towards them they moved to
meet me, but at this moment Barbour and
Carruthers made their appearance behind me.
This was quite enough for my enemies. Without
a word they turned and ran off at full speed,
taking different directions as they reached the
main road. We gave chase, but they ran as fast
as we did, and we soon lost them in the darkness.</p>

<p>It was annoying to have let the fellows slip
through our fingers, but there was some satisfaction
in knowing that I was in no danger
when with friends, and that Wyngate's emissaries
were not conspicuous for courage. Like himself,
no doubt, they were ready to strike only
when there was no danger of being caught.</p>

<p>As soon as possible after returning to London
I gave up my rooms, stored such of my belongings
as were not portable, and went to live at
my club, on the principle that there is safety in
numbers. In this I was again mistaken, as I
was soon to learn.</p>

<p>A fortnight later I went to a fancy dress ball
at the Covent Garden Opera house. I had just
been chatting with an acquaintance, and was
standing amid a small group of people who
were strangers to me, at the top of the grand
staircase, looking down at the people coming up,
when I felt myself suddenly seized from behind
and hurled down the steps. I was completely
taken by surprise and could do nothing to
save myself. My unknown assailant no doubt
reckoned that my head would come into contact
with the wall at the bottom of the flight of steps,
and that I should either be killed or badly hurt.
By great good luck, however, a portly commissionaire,
taking tickets, was standing just in
the right spot, and I dashed into him with great
violence, bowling him over like a ninepin, but
luckily without hurting him. I was stunned by
the shock, and by the time I recovered it was
of course useless to look for the man who had
thrown me down the staircase. He must have
shadowed me for some time and chosen his
moment well, for no one saw the act, unless it
be that he had accomplices who screened him
from observation.</p>

<p>After this fourth experience I confessed that
my nerve was considerably shaken. To go on
living by myself in London was only to court
disaster and live in daily expectation of a fifth
attempt on my life. I need not trouble the
reader with the details of my consultations with
the Benedicts and my father, who became
reconciled to me on hearing my story. The
end of it was that, after a few months' strict
seclusion with a coach in the country, I entered
the Militia.</p>

<p>At L&mdash;&mdash;, where I am stationed, I ought
to be fairly safe among my brother officers
and the soldiers. And yet, who knows?
Perhaps Wyngate (who goes about openly in
London, dines at the best restaurants, and stares
defiantly at friends of mine who know the story)
is tired of pursuing me, or thinks the game is
not worth the candle. I hope so, at any rate,
for I sometimes feel that if he keeps to his
purpose he will, sooner or later, achieve it.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Victor Forbin.</span></p>

<p class="center">A vivacious account by a French journalist of his introduction to a curious sport of
which practically nothing is known in this country.

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i0056dc.jpg" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">For</span> a long time a hotbed of patriotic
Anglophobia, St. Malo, the ancient
city whose proud boast it is that it
has never been conquered, has been
of recent years quietly annexed, so
to speak, by its former foe, and has become a
popular resort with English tourists, so that the
poorest of its shops is proud to display on its
front windows the welcoming motto, "English
spoken."</p>

<p>The Malouins themselves are the boldest
sailors of France; it is a saying among them
that "they have the love of the sea in their
blood." The sons and grandsons of daring
privateers, they pass nearly their whole lives
at sea, many of them going every year to the
Grand Banks of Newfoundland for the cod-fishing
season.</p>

<p>Even the well-to-do classes, gentry or bourgeoisie,
are fond of maritime pastimes such as
fishing and yachting. Their favourite diversion,
however, is dolphin-hunting, a sport which the
authorities encourage by every means in their
power, since dolphins and porpoises are causing
terrible havoc among the schools of herring and
sardines on the French coast, thus destroying
the livelihood of the fisher-folk.</p>

TO FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS, AND MAY REACH NINE FEET IN LENGTH.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">From a Photograph.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>During a recent stay in the suburbs of St.
Malo, my host insisted upon introducing me to
the enchantment of a sport of whose very
existence I had hitherto been ignorant.</p>

<p>"You cannot possibly return to Paris until
you have killed your porpoise, can you?" he
asked, insinuatingly.</p>

<p>"I am here for rest, not for butchery," I
replied, indolently.</p>

<p>"But just think of the story you will have to
tell," he continued. "A dolphin hunt! It is
old to us Malouins, but what a novelty for you,
a newspaper man, a Parisian!"</p>

<p>"A novelty, to be sure," I returned. "But
what about sunstroke? I tell you, my dear
Desmond, in this terrific heat the shade of your
apple trees is good enough for me. Bother your
dolphin-hunting!"</p>

<p>That is what I told him, and at the moment
I meant it; yet I must confess that I allowed
myself to be conquered in the end by a monetary
argument.</p>

<p>"But you're losing money," urged my host.
"You forget that a certain official is ready to
pay you a five-franc piece for each dolphin's
head you may bring him!"</p>

<p>Five francs! I rose to the bait. What glory
for a writer to be able to boast that he has
earned money with his gun! How I could
crow over my fellow-scribes! So, tempted by
glorious visions of many five-franc pieces, I
weakly surrendered.</p>

<p>It is quite likely that dreams of sport caused
me to sleep more soundly than I ought to have
done, for when my friend's shouts awoke me at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
last I unjustly scolded my alarm-clock, which
had done its duty.</p>

<p>Fortunately, everything was ready, down to
the <i lang="fr">caf&eacute;-au-lait</i> and <i lang="fr">petit pain</i> that the maid was
bringing in. A few minutes later I hastily jumped
aboard the yacht <i lang="fr">Christiane</i>, where Desmond
and his <i lang="fr">mousse</i> (cabin-boy), Jean-Marie Le
Floch, were waiting for me, meanwhile endeavouring
to ascertain from some old salts in
which direction and at about what distance out
we should be likely to meet with a school of
<i lang="fr">marsouins</i>.</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr">Marsouins?</i>" ejaculated one old fisherman,
between puffs at his pipe. "The confounded
vermin are to be met with everywhere and
nowhere."</p>

<p>Never expect, by the way, to receive precise
information from a Breton fisherman. But
never mind; we shall reach our objective some
time or other with the help of the breeze and
the good-will of the dolphins!</p>

<p>Presently the yacht was ploughing her way
gracefully through the waves, and for the time
being we had nothing else to do but search the
horizon and talk about our intended victims.
Meanwhile I learnt from my friend many
interesting details about dolphins and their
ways.</p>

<p>It appears that several species of dolphins are
to be met with near the shores of Brittany.
The largest is known to science as <i lang="fr">Delphinus
delphis</i>, and differs from other varieties by its
long jaws&mdash;very like the beak of a big bird, and
armed with about sixty teeth as hard and sharp
as steel. Its length may reach nine feet, and it
weighs from three to four hundred pounds. A
swift swimmer, it preys on the schools of herrings,
following them right up to Scottish waters. In
spite of its greed, it is noted for its mild temper,
and frequently amuses itself by playing round
ships in the open sea.</p>

<p>Then there is the <i lang="fr">Delphinus tursio</i>, or
<i lang="fr">souffleur</i>. This is smaller, and its beak is
shorter, though armed with strong, powerful
teeth that enable it to attack a big fish, pinning
it down to the rocks with such force that its nose
is often deeply marked with numerous cuts.
This dolphin hates the very sight of a ship and
never comes close to one.</p>

<p>My friend was beginning to tell me something
about the porpoise, or <i lang="fr">marsouin</i>, the smallest
species of the genus, when Jean-Marie Le Floch
put an end to the scientific discourse by a
sudden shout. He was positive, he declared,
that he had just seen a dolphin jumping out of
the water about five hundred yards ahead of us!</p>

<p>"Are you quite certain about it, <i lang="fr">mon gar&ccedil;on</i>?"
said Desmond, eagerly grasping his gun. "Did
you really?"</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr">Tenez, m'sieur!</i>" replied the lad. "There!
there! Did you see it?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p>A YACHT CHASING A SCHOOL OF DOLPHINS.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">From a Photograph.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Sure enough, a black object
had just shot out of the water,
disappearing again so quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
that I almost thought I had made a mistake.
Not so my friend. He had seen enough to convince
him that the dolphin was coming towards
us at full speed, and accordingly got his gun
ready, meanwhile giving me some rapid hints
about the best way of shooting.</p>

<p>"Now, don't aim at the head," he told me.
"Never at the head, whatever you do."</p>

<p>"What a queer idea!" said I. "Wouldn't a
bullet through its head stop it dead?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i0058.jpg" width="700" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>HAULING A DOLPHIN INTO THE YACHT'S DINGHY.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">From a Photograph.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>"Most certainly; but you would waste your
powder and shot. The dolphin would sink at
once, taking away to the depths of the ocean
both your bullet and your five-franc premium.
No; you must aim squarely at the belly. Otherwise&mdash;&mdash;Dear
me!"</p>

<p>At that very moment the dolphin jumped clear
out of the waves quite close to us. Swift as
lightning Desmond aimed at the flying monster,
shining in the sunlight about a hundred yards
ahead, and pulled trigger.</p>

<p>"Well done! A splendid shot!" I shouted
enthusiastically, as the bullet took effect and the
dolphin disappeared.</p>

<p>"It was <i lang="fr">too</i> splendid!" grumbled Desmond.</p>

<p>Without another word he jumped into the
dinghy, towing astern, where the boy was already
waiting for him, a harpoon in his hand.</p>

<p>"Keep an eye upon it as soon as it comes
up," he shouted to me, as he scrambled for an
oar.</p>

<p>"There it is! I see it, bleeding!" I cried.
The wounded dolphin had reappeared a short
distance away, the foam of the waves around
being tinted red with its life-blood. Pointing
out the right direction to the pair in the boat,
I shouted a few remarks after them.</p>

<p>"I should say it is sinking. Make haste!
<i lang="fr">D&eacute;p&ecirc;chez-vous!</i> It is turning over on its back;
I see only its white underside. Quick! Quick!"</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr">Malheur de ma vie!</i>" I heard Desmond
groaning in despair.</p>

<p>Under his very nose, just at the moment
when Jean-Marie Le Floch was about to throw
his harpoon, the white spot suddenly disappeared;
the sea had swallowed the dead
dolphin in an instant.</p>

<p>At that moment of bitter disappointment I
foresaw the sad <i lang="fr">d&eacute;nouement</i> of the venture: our
shameful return empty-handed to the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
harbour amid the sneers of the old fishermen,
who would inquire eagerly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What about the porpoises, gentlemen?
How many dolphins are you bringing in?"</p>

<p>Assuredly there must be a special Providence
which looks after hunters&mdash;especially amateur
ones. Just as I was about to sit down, in a fit
of despair, a flash caught my eye. Less than
sixty yards from the bow, where I was standing,
and at about half that distance from the dinghy,
a school of dolphins had suddenly appeared!</p>

<p>With a quick motion I seized my gun, and as
I raised it to my shoulder my friend's admonitions
were clean forgotten.</p>

<p>Bang! bang! bang! A positive frenzy of
slaughter appeared to have taken hold of me,
and I kept on shooting just as long as the
magazine of my rifle held out. Meanwhile the
two spectators in the dinghy were frantic with
joy. Never in my life have I heard so thick a
rain of flattering words as they showered upon
me then.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 517px;">

<div class="caption"><p>THE CABIN-BOY WITH THE LAST DOLPHIN SHOT BY THE AUTHOR.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">From a Photograph.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>It is quite likely that several of my victims sank
while breathing their last, for I really
cannot believe that a single one of my
dozen shots missed its mark. Be this
as it may, however, I had undoubtedly
broken the record in dolphin-hunting,
for, as a matter of fact, Desmond and
the boy succeeded in
harpooning and bringing
back half-a-dozen
of the creatures.</p>

<p>I am satisfied that Desmond is a sincere and
trustworthy friend. Nevertheless, I am not prepared
to swear that he was not just a little bit
envious when we re-entered the harbour a few
minutes after noon. Just think of it! He,
the veteran hunter, was coming back as he had
gone, empty-handed, whereas his pupil&mdash;the man
to whom he had had to explain what dolphin-hunting
was&mdash;would be able to bring to-morrow
to the <i lang="fr">commissaire des p&ecirc;ches</i>, the responsible
official, six dolphin tails, receiving from that
worthy no less a sum than thirty francs! Truly
it must have been a sad blow for him.</p>

<p>Later in the afternoon the tide brought in a
dying dolphin, too weak to resist the flood and
fight its way towards the open sea. Success
makes one generous, and I begged of Jean-Marie
Le Floch to help himself
freely and take possession of the
tail of my seventh dolphin, asking
him, by way of exchange, to
pose as heroically as possible in
front of the camera by the side
of my last victim.</p>

<p>Such was the <i lang="fr">d&eacute;but</i> of a
Parisian journalist as a dolphin-hunter.
Do not ask me if I
went out again on a similar quest.
My initial exploit has established
my reputation as a
dead shot, and I do
not care to risk the
loss of my laurels.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Major D. G. Prendergast.</span>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A grim story of love, hate, and relentless vengeance. "The events occurred in the early
'eighties," writes Major Prendergast. "I learnt all the facts and met Mahkmoud, the central
character, in the course of my official duties."</p></div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i0060dc.jpg" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> first act of this tragedy of real
life took place at a small village a
few miles south of Assiout, the chief
town of what in the 'eighties was
known as Upper Egypt.</p>

<p>It was the end of September, after the
Nile had overflowed its banks, and the crops
were full and green. The time was evening,
and Mahkmoud, one of the principal actors in
my story, was sitting on the sun-dried mud wall
of one of the <em>shadoofs</em> (irrigation wells) which
watered his land. He was at this time a man of
some consequence in his village, and for a fellah
was counted rich, being the owner of a fair-sized
piece of fertile land. He was a man over six feet
in height, with the broad sinewy back and
shoulders and general physical strength which
is the heritage of the fellaheen race of the
Nile Valley. His head was large and bullet-shaped,
his neck thick-set, his eyes keen and
deep-set, while his mouth and chin plainly
indicated that he was a man possessed of great
determination and of unusually strong passions.</p>

<p>To-night he sat and gazed moodily into the
dark, transparent waters of the rushing stream,
black thoughts of vengeance crowding into his
brain, for he was in sore trouble. Of late the
village gossips had been busy connecting the
name of his young wife, Rukhia, with one
Abdul, the ne'er-do-weel of the place.</p>

<p>In a small community no secret can remain
hidden for long, and although, naturally,
Mahkmoud would be the last to hear of the
scandal, still it was only a matter of time before
it reached his ears. Only to-day his friends had
hinted to him that his wife was, perhaps, not quite
all he thought her to be, and the name of Abdul
was at the same time carelessly introduced into
the conversation. Now, Abdul had only been
back in his native village for six months; for
the past seven years, previous to his return, he
had been serving his Highness the Khedive as
a conscript soldier in the Egyptian army.</p>

<p>The fellaheen of Egypt make docile, tractable
soldiers, amenable to discipline, keen on all
routine work and peace soldiering, but lacking
that <em>&eacute;lan</em> and dash which are so valuable an
asset in time of war. Even in the Egyptian
army, however, there are bad characters, and
for these there is a special corps&mdash;a sort of
"Lost Legion." This corps is known as the
Discipline Company, and the life led by its
members is little better than that of the convict.
Their uniform is of a much brighter yellow than
khaki, and each man wears an iron ring welded
round his right ankle. Abdul had finished the
last three years of his service in this ill-starred
company. News spreads in a mysterious way
from village to village along the hundreds of
miles from Cairo to the frontier, and tidings of
Abdul's doings during his soldiering career
had somehow reached his native village. It
was not of a sort which was likely to ensure a
warm welcome for him on his return.</p>

<p>During the three years Abdul served out his
time in the Discipline Company he became
intimately acquainted with many men who were
among the scum of the earth. When at length
the period of service in this Legion of the Lost
was concluded, and its members returned to the
world and civil life, as often as not they led lives
of crime and infamy which generally brought
them within reach of the law, so that most of
them ended their days in the convict prisons of
Tourah or Tokar, and the very worst of all in
the hulk moored in Trinkitat Bay.</p>

<p>Years ago, before the lot of the conscript
soldier had fallen on Abdul, Mahkmoud and he
had had bitter quarrels over the question of the
irrigation of their respective lands, which were
adjacent to each other.</p>

<p>The water of the Nile is the very life-blood of
the fellaheen, and he who secretly or by stealth
diverts the water from his neighbour's land on
to his own is guilty of a heinous crime. In days
gone by Mahkmoud had more than sufficient
reason to suspect that the water from his <em>shadoofs</em>
and <em>sakiehs</em> had helped to irrigate his neighbour's
land. Many angry words had been exchanged
in consequence, and a lifelong feud had been
established between the two men.</p>

<p>On the evening of the day this story opens,
Mahkmoud sat and brooded over all he had
lately heard. Many little incidents in connection
with his young wife, to which at the time
he had hardly given a passing thought, now
seemed to rise up clearly before him. He
realized that within the past six months his wife
had changed from a pattern of domestic
drudgery&mdash;the usual lot of a fellah's wife&mdash;to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
a listless, slovenly woman who found work too
much for her. Often on his return from a long
day's labour in the fields he would find the
evening meal not yet ready, the fuel not
gathered, and the <em>ziehs</em> (earthen water-jars)
only half filled. Even his two little boys, who
had hitherto been the joy of their mother's life,
did not seem any longer to interest her.
Mahkmoud also remembered, now that his
jealousy was aroused, how frequently on his
return he found his wife out&mdash;absent from home
at hours when it is unusual for women to be
away from their domestic duties. There had
even been an occasion when Mahkmoud had
come home in the grey dawn from watching his
crops by night and scaring away wild animals,
when he found her outside the wall which
surrounded his house. At the time he thought
it strange, but was satisfied with some paltry
excuse. Now, all these incidents loomed large
before his gaze, and he understood their meaning.
To-night he vowed he would take a terrible
revenge&mdash;revenge upon his hated enemy and
on his faithless wife. He would wait and
watch; he would bide his time. When it came,
the punishment he would mete out to the guilty
pair would live in the memory of his village for
all time.</p>

<p>About a month before the events just described
a stranger arrived in the village, and the
first man he met happened to be Mahkmoud.
To him the new-comer told a plausible story of
how he had worked for the eccentric sawerheen
(white travellers) who were always digging
amongst the ruins of the ancient temples.
Having scraped together enough money to
enable him to return to his native village near
Wady Halfa, he was on his journey back, when
he had fallen amongst thieves and lost all he
possessed. He asked Mahkmoud to help him
by giving him employment during the season of
the crops. For a few pence a day he worked
for Mahkmoud&mdash;irrigating the fields, watching
his flocks of goats by day, and taking his turn
in frightening off wild animals from the
growing crops at night. He slept in a mud
hovel with the goats, inside the sun-baked
mud wall which surrounded Mahkmoud's
dwelling-houses. He was a taciturn man,
with an evil-looking countenance. He spoke to
no one, and no one spoke to him. If mentioned
in conversation, men referred to him as "ibn el
kelp" (son of a dog), and mothers warned their
children to flee from his path should they meet
him, and on no account whatever to look at him,
for he was a man possessed of "the evil eye"
and would cast a spell over them.</p>

<p>There was one man in the village, however,
who knew this stranger, and the stranger knew
him. Abdul and the goatherd had toiled
together for many a weary day, with the iron
ring on their ankles, in the ranks of the Discipline
Company. By tacit consent they never openly
recognised one another, and, as far as anyone
knew, had never been seen to speak to each
other. Both inwardly feared one another and
wondered when the other would give him away.
As a cat watches a mouse so did this stranger
watch Abdul, and it was not very long before he
had made himself acquainted with information
for which it seemed that either Abdul, his
enemy, or Mahkmoud, his master, might think
it worth while to pay him handsomely.</p>

<p>One night, when his employer was away
keeping watch over his crops, he lay awake in
his shed and heard footsteps steal silently past
where he lay. Then he heard the door of the
walled enclosure quietly opened and shut.
Scenting that something was amiss, the goatherd
stranger rose and silently went in pursuit.
Seeing nothing, he hid himself amongst the
mimosa bushes, which grew thick on both sides
of the narrow path leading from the door to the
river-bank. Presently, from his place of concealment,
he beheld two forms walking up from
the direction of the river towards the house,
and as they slowly passed the spot where he lay
hidden the watcher, by the light of the stars,
recognised beyond a doubt who the couple
were. "Allah is great, and Mohammed is His
Prophet," murmured the stranger. "My enemy
has now been delivered into my hands. I will
demand from the dog the sum of twenty
Egyptian pounds, and if he will not give them
to me&mdash;then my employer knows all."</p>

<p>As the door softly closed, out of the deep
shadow of the wall one figure retraced its steps
along the path towards the river. It was Abdul.
When he arrived at the spot where the path was
narrowed by the mimosa bushes, the watcher
rose up and, stepping to the path, confronted
his man. Speaking in a low, hissing voice, he
said, "Abdul, you know me. I am a man of
few words, and my words to you this night are
few."</p>

<p>Abdul, taken unawares, stood still, trembling,
and then, recognising who it was that spoke,
answered, "What do you want with me at this
hour of night, you offspring of a snake?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you," the stranger replied.
"Since my sojourn here I have been employed
in watching my master's property; both by day
and by night I have driven the noxious animals
away. But there is one foul bird of night that
I have not driven away, and that, O Abdul, is
yourself. Now I will make this compact with
you, who are in my power. If you will give
me the sum of twenty Egyptian pounds at noon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
to-morrow I will
go forth from
here and return
no more; and
my lips shall be
for ever sealed.
This I will swear
by the beard of
the Prophet."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 529px;">

<div class="caption"><p>"HE MOVED FORWARD AS THOUGH TO PASS HIS MAN, WHEN THE KNIFE FLASHED DOWNWARDS."</p></div>
</div>

<p>The stranger
folded his arms
and stood silent,
awaiting the
reply.</p>

<p>After a pause,
which to both
men seemed an
age, Abdul replied,
"And if I
refuse this price
of blackmail,
how then? What
can you do&mdash;a
stranger and a
dog? Who, think
you, will believe
your perjured
evidence?"</p>

<p>The goatherd
did not immediately
reply,
and for a space
the two men
stood confronting
each other.
Abdul was wearing
a <em>gallibeah</em>&mdash;a
long cloak
reaching from
the neck to the
feet, made of
thick cotton
stuff, with very
large loose sleeves. The stranger was dressed,
as he slept, in a cotton shirt and drawers. So
it happened that Abdul was able, unseen by his
foe, to draw his knife from its sheath. (All the
natives of this country carry a big knife in a
sheath strapped to the left arm, just above the
elbow.)</p>

<p>After a few moments had elapsed the stranger
laughed a short, derisive laugh, and, putting
out his arm, as if to brush Abdul aside, said,
"You fool! At the rising of to-morrow's sun
Mahkmoud shall know all." With that he
moved forward as though to pass his man,
when the knife flashed downwards, and with
a choking, gurgling sound, followed by a deep
sigh, he sank to the earth, never to rise again!</p>

<p>Abdul's knife had been driven home to the
hilt through his heart, and the luckless goatherd's
life-blood gushed out in a dark red
stream, spreading over the pathway. Abdul,
having made sure that there was no chance of
life remaining, dragged the corpse into the
bushes, and hurriedly returned to the door in
the shadow of the wall. Here he imitated the
cry of the night-bird&mdash;the preconcerted signal
between himself and Rukhia. After a pause
the door was quietly opened once more, and in
the dark shadow Abdul hurriedly told her all
that had happened. Before they parted it was
arranged as to what should be said and done on
the morrow. The blood-stained knife was hidden
by the wife in Mahkmoud's sleeping apartment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
Her part of the crime was that she should gain
possession of her husband's knife after he had
sunk into the deep sleep which usually came
upon him after a night of watching, and throw
it into the river.</p>

<p>The sun had scarcely risen above the line of
the sand-hills on the eastern bank before the
whole village was astir and excitedly discussing
what was undoubtedly a murder. The Yushbashi
(captain) of police at Assiout was in due
course informed. He and his men arrived
later, and after much talking and taking down
of numerous notes which had little bearing on
the subject he ordered the body of the murdered
man to be carried to Assiout, almost half the
population of the village accompanying him as
well.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>ASSIOUT, WHERE MAHKMOUD WAS TRIED FOR HIS LIFE.</p>

<p><em>From a Photograph.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>"The Mudir (the Egyptian governor) shall
decide who is the culprit," said the officer.</p>

<p>The police, of course, had to find a culprit,
and also procure sufficient evidence to convict
him, and this they proceeded to do. As the
result of their investigations the unhappy
Mahkmoud was placed on his trial for the
murder. He pleaded "Not guilty," but otherwise
had no defence, admitting that he was
absent from home from nine o'clock on the
night of the murder until about half-past four
the next morning. The police produced evidence
that the murdered man and Mahkmoud were
not on good terms, that Mahkmoud's shoes were
covered with blood, and that they exactly fitted
the footsteps on the path leading from the scene
of the murder to the house. It was also hinted
that there was an intrigue between the stranger
and the wife. Finally, the prosecution produced
the blood-stained knife and sheath, which had
been discovered in a rat-hole in Mahkmoud's
sleeping apartment. In addition, two important
witnesses were called. One was Abdul, who
swore that on the fatal night he was watching
his crops some five hundred yards from the spot
where the body was found, and heard voices in
angry altercation some two hours before sunrise.</p>

<p>Rukhia, Mahkmoud's wife, then appeared, to
everyone's astonishment, and told a graphic
story of how she was awakened some little time
before sunrise, and heard the voices of the
stranger and her husband in a heated argument.
Mahkmoud then returned, much
excited and swearing fiercely.
In the morning she noticed the
blood-stained shoes and missed
the knife from the shelf where
it was usually put. Later it was
found by the police who searched
the house.</p>

<p>Mahkmoud, in spite of his
protestations of innocence, was
found guilty&mdash;mainly on the
circumstantial evidence of his
wife and Abdul. He was
sentenced to death, which
sentence was subsequently commuted
to penal servitude for
the term of his natural life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It would take too long to
follow this miserable but innocent
convict through the weary
years he spent working out his
awful doom. To be able to realize what an
Egyptian convict's life is like one must at least
have seen the prisons and the hulk. The first
five years were spent in the prison at Tourah.
The very fact that this man&mdash;so strong willed
and passionate by nature&mdash;was innocent drove
him to the verge of frenzy, and having become
known as a dangerous and violent convict
he found himself confined first in a solitary
cell, and then drafted to the prison at Tokar.
Here he was compelled to associate with the
very worst criminals in Egypt; and, breaking
the rules again, he was sentenced to undergo
the remainder of his imprisonment on board the
hulk in Trinkitat Bay.</p>

<p>It is enough to say that this bay is on the
Red Sea littoral, a terrible place for any living
man, white or black, to have to spend his life.
It was in this hulk that the writer saw Mahkmoud.
Escape from this floating jail is practically
impossible. It is moored some seven hundred
yards from the shore, and the water teems with
sharks, who do not allow much to escape their
observant eyes as they continually cruise round
the hulk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>Many times poor wretches doomed to this
living grave have escaped from Tokar Prison.
It is easy, for the prison is only built of mud
and wattle, and the warders are very careless.
But up to the time I shall describe
later no prisoner had been known to get far
away.</p>

<p>Nomad tribes of Somalis and Arabs (the
"Fuzzy-Wuzzies" of the days of our fierce
fights at El Teb and Tamai, Tokar and
McNeill's Zareba) live and move all round this
part of the bush, occupying the few wells there
are, right up to the Erkoweit hills. The
Government give the head-men of these tribes
substantial rewards for each fugitive they capture
and bring in, so that the convict's chance of
escape is infinitesimal. They must go to these
tribes for food and water, or die of hunger and
thirst in the desert.</p>

<p>The Nile is the very life and soul of the
Egyptian fellah, and the captives of the Kings
of Assyria, who sat down by the waters of
Babylon and wept, could not have longed more
passionately for their Jewish homes than did
these poor outcasts to see once more their
native villages and taste "the sweet waters of
the Nile."</p>

<p>"If I can but escape and reach those distant
hills," they told themselves, "then I can easily
walk over them. There may still be a few miles of
desert sand to cross, but it will surely at length
bring me once again to the great beloved river,
our Father Nile." This remark has been made
to the writer times without number when visiting
the convict gangs at work in the course of his
official duties. But one and all of the hapless
wretches reckoned without the far-stretching,
arid sands or the prowling nomads, ever on the
watch for fugitives.</p>

<p>One hot, still, starlight night, towards the end
of the seventh year of his penal servitude,
whilst the sentry was snugly rolled up in his
blanket, Mahkmoud slipped overboard from the
hulk and swam shorewards. He had seen the
sharks cruising slowly round the hulk for many
a long day, but, as he said in after years when
telling the story of his escape, "Better become
food for sharks than endure a living death." As
luck would have it, he reached the beach safely,
and after wandering towards the distant hills all
that day and night he was overcome with hunger
and thirst and, resigning himself to his fate, lay
down under the sparse shadow of a thorn-bush
to die. But Providence decreed otherwise. He
was found by a party of raiding Baggara horsemen,
who carried him off to Adharama, the
head-quarters of the celebrated Dervish Emir,
Osman Digna.</p>

<p>For the next two years Mahkmoud was a
household slave in Osman Digna's house.
While he was there the Khalifa sent for his
Governor of the Eastern Sudan, and Mahkmoud
accompanied his master. So once more,
after nine long years, he again set eyes on the
River Nile.</p>

<p>Even now it was almost impossible to escape,
for the wild Arab tribes who at this time held
sway over the country from Sarras to Fashoda
loathed and despised the Egyptian fellah, and
no one would help him. After three more years
of bondage, however, spent between the Eastern
Sudan and Omdurman, Mahkmoud escaped,
joined a caravan which was bringing gum and
ostrich feathers to the Egyptian frontier, and at
last found himself on the Egyptian Nile at
Assouan.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>By this time "the murder," as it was generally
referred to, had almost been forgotten by the
villagers. If it was mentioned at all it was as
an historical event, generally to fix the date of
some other event which had occurred before or
since.</p>

<p>The people, too, had almost forgotten
Mahkmoud's existence; he was either dead or
as good as dead. Abdul, in due course, had
taken Rukhia to his harem as a wife, and she
was the mother of his three children. After
Mahkmoud's transportation his brother, as is
usually the case when a widow re-marries, had
taken over the care of his nephews, together
with his brother's land and property.</p>

<p>It was again September, and the hour before
sunset, when the women of the village had gone
to draw water for their households. Abdul was
sitting in his house, and his three children were
asleep in the adjoining room. Suddenly a
shadow was thrown across the room. Abdul
turned quickly, half rising as he did so, to see
who it was. But in an instant strong hands
gripped his throat, and a voice, to him a terrible
one, hoarsely hissed into his ear, "It is I,
Mahkmoud, who after many years have not
forgotten you!" Then a knife flashed for one
moment before his terrified eyes, and in another
second Abdul lay dead upon the floor, dead as
his victim had lain in the path that fateful night
twelve years before!</p>

<p>Later Rukhia returned. The room was almost
dark and, before she realized that anything out
of the ordinary had occurred, unseen hands
seized her from the darkness and a voice, as it
were of the dead, said, "It is your husband
Mahkmoud who speaks to you, you false and
perjured woman. Go now to where Abdul has
gone!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At dawn next day Mahkmoud walked calmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
into the police-station at Assiout. Here he
asked to see the Yushbashi of police, and when
brought before him said, very quietly, "My name
is Mahkmoud. Twelve years ago I was, through
the false and perjured testimony of my wife and
her lover, convicted of murder and sentenced to
death. Now I <em>am</em> a murderer. Arrest me.
I have spoken."</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"IT IS YOUR HUSBAND MAHKMOUD WHO SPEAKS TO YOU, YOU FALSE AND PERJURED WOMAN."</p></div>
</div>

<p>For a second time Mahkmoud was tried for
his life in Assiout, found guilty on his own confession,
and sentenced to death. His Highness
the Khedive once again commuted his sentence
to penal servitude for life.</p>

<p>After five years, during which Mahkmoud's
character was exemplary, he received a free
pardon, and returned once more to his native
village, where he died, an old and broken man.
There is an Arab proverb, "If once you have
tasted the sweet waters of the Nile, you will
return to drink of them again."</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">When</span>, nine years ago, I first set out
from Melbourne bound for British
New Guinea&mdash;or Papua, as it is now
officially called&mdash;I had very vague
ideas about how to reach it, or what
it would be like when I got there. I knew that
New Guinea was a large island lying off the
extreme north of Australia, and that the part I
was going to was a little south of the Equator,
but that was about all. However, I was told
that I should catch a boat at Sydney which was
sailing for Samarai, the island port of Papua,
and that there I
should be met by the
schooner of the Anglican
Mission. I might
have to finish the
journey in a whaleboat,
I was informed,
so my belongings had
better be packed in
small boxes. Thereupon
I set off, armed
with a thousand
tabloids of quinine, a
defence against malarial
fever, which everyone
in Papua contracts
more or less badly as
a matter of course.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE HOSPITAL AT SAMARAI, THE PICTURESQUE CAPITAL OF PAPUA.</p>

<p><em>From a Photograph.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Although the distance
was not very
great, the voyage took
nearly three weeks,
for we certainly did not
hurry. The captain
was a cautious old
man, and every night,
during one "reefy"
part of the trip, our
anchor went down at six o'clock, not to be
hauled up till the same hour next morning.</p>

<p>Then, too, instead of making for Samarai, we
rounded Cape York and visited Thursday
Island, where we remained for some days.
Moreover, after calling at Port Moresby, on the
south coast of Papua, we deliberately went sixty
miles out of our way to land some members of
the Roman Catholic Mission at Yule Island,
their head station.</p>

<p>But at last, one morning, we reached Samarai&mdash;and
a very pretty little place I thought it, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
it is now much altered by the addition of a
number of stores and Government buildings.
One of the latter, the hospital, is shown on the
previous page. Four little hills rose in the centre
of the tiny island, surrounded by a picturesque,
though unhealthy, swamp. Gorgeous crotons
blazed with crimson and gold in the tropical
sunlight, and thick clusters of palms&mdash;coco,
areca, and sago&mdash;swayed gently in the wind,
while their stiff leaves rustled in a most misleading
manner, imitating a heavy shower of
rain. Papaw trees hung their graceful sprays
of waxen blossom, or stood upright under their
load of ripening yellow fruit.</p>

<p>When the schooner eventually arrived, after
some little delay, she began to load up with
stores, comprising food (mostly tinned), trade
goods, and medicines. After this was accomplished
I went on board, and
the last stage of my voyage
began. I had not been on
a sailing vessel before, and
though I tried hard to
believe we were actually
moving, the breeze was so
light that it required a
great effort. On subsequent
journeys I learned to be
thankful if we did not
actually retreat instead of
advance, for one morning I
woke and heard the captain
say, "We're ten miles farther
back than we were last night!"</p>

<p>However, we drifted
peacefully along the coast,
with an unvarying mountain
range in the background,
looking as though gigantic
tiger-skin rugs had been
thrown over it. The
natives, I was informed,
had produced this effect
by burning the grass
when hunting boars
and wallabies. Occasionally
we would pass
groups of coco palms,
which denoted the
existence of a village
beneath them. Then,
one morning, quite
suddenly we found ourselves
at our destination,
and I stepped
ashore to be surrounded
by crowds of excited
natives, to whom
the advent of a white
woman had not lost the charm of novelty.</p>

<p>The village of Wedau, where I disembarked,
had been, not many years before, the scene of
frequent cannibal feasts. The Wedauans had
lived in a state of continual feud with the hill-folk
and other tribes at a distance, and had
sallied forth on various occasions to fight with
them on any convenient "merewa" or battlefield.
The photograph here reproduced shows
a group of natives on an old "merewa," and
illustrates the method by which hapless captives
were carried off the field in the bad old days, to
be afterwards cooked and eaten.</p>

<p>The victim, sometimes only stunned or
wounded, was lashed by the hands and feet
to a stout pole, which was borne on men's
shoulders through the village. Sometimes several
of these unhappy wretches were captured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
at a time, and the treatment they received
before being mercifully killed was cruel to a
degree. Samuela Aigeri, a Wedauan Christian,
once related to me incidents of great barbarity
which had taken place in the village in connection
with the slaughter of a man taken
prisoner by the villagers. The poor wretch
asked in vain for water to drink, and was stoned
and otherwise tormented for a considerable time
before being given the <i lang="fr">coup de gr&acirc;ce</i>. This was
customary.</p>

<p>I soon discovered that European housekeeping
in Papua is charmingly simple. Everything
arrived in a tin, for the most part ready
for use. Meat, milk, butter, vegetables&mdash;all
stood in tins in neat rows in the storeroom. A
diet of tinned stuffs grew rather monotonous at
times, but we were able occasionally to vary it.
Sometimes a man would arrive with a live turtle,
which he would sell for two sticks of tobacco,
costing threepence. The wretched turtle would
be killed and cut up, but would still insist on
quivering in a most realistic manner even when
placed on the fire to cook. Then, too, if the
season was a good one, the kitchen would be
found lined with joints of wallabies, and it would
be hard to know what to do with so much
fresh meat.</p>

</div>

<p>I remember once thinking that smoked wallaby
would be a change, and I asked the little cook-boy
if he could get some done for me. He
assented willingly, and bore a leg off to where he
said there was an "ovo" or platform for smoking
meat. In a few days it was returned to me and
looked most appetizing. We cut a dish full of
delicate slices, and were just about to set it on
the dining-table, when I thought of asking the
cook-boy how it had been prepared. He told
me quite cheerfully that he had given it to an
old leper woman, who, being ill, could not leave
the house, and so was sure to keep the fire
alight. It was she we had to thank for so
kindly smoking our meat. Needless to say, the
dish did not appear on the table that night.</p>

<p>Girls as well as boys learned cooking when at
the mission station. One girl was considered a
very good cook, so much so that on one occasion
she was trusted to prepare a meal by herself, as
everyone had gone for a picnic. She was told
to make rissoles of what she found in the safe.
The pudding, a Christmas one, was to follow.</p>

<p>At evening the party returned and sat down,
hungry and tired, to eat. Surely, they thought, the
rissoles tasted rather peculiar. However, they
were eaten, and demands made for the pudding.</p>

<p>"But you have had the pudding," was the
model cook's answer; "it was in the rissoles!"</p>

<p>Laundry work was sometimes carried on under
great difficulties. At one station the water
supply was some distance away, and was brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
weekly by bullocks which dragged a heavy "slide"
on which our pails stood. The bullocks were
occasionally obstreperous, on which occasions
the supply of water was sadly diminished.
Moreover, when it was safely placed in the
laundry the ducks hastened thither and bathed
luxuriously in each tub, leaving behind them
cloudy water plentifully besprinkled with feathers.
At night our girl boarders, feeling thirsty, would
ask if they might drink from the tubs and would
gratefully receive permission to do so, quite
undeterred by the fact that many ducks had
bathed in the water, which, I should have
mentioned, was so "hard" that no soap ever
formed a lather. It may be imagined, therefore,
what the clothes looked like when returned from
the wash.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>A TYPICAL NATIVE HOUSE.</p>

<p><em>From a Photograph.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Papuan marriage customs are interesting and
rather intricate. In Collingwood Bay, for instance,
the bride is mourned over for some days
beforehand by her girl friends, who are losing
their playmate. Then she is dressed in her best,
presented with many gifts, and a procession is
formed to take her to her new home.</p>

<p>The bridegroom is never to be found on his
wedding-day. It is etiquette for him to go hunting
or on some expedition which will take him
from the village. His relatives, however, look
after his interests and hasten the lagging footsteps
of the wedding procession by lavish bribes.
On arriving at the house the bride and her maids
of honour enter and remain for the night, while
the elders return home.</p>

<p>In the morning the poor little bride is deserted
by her girl friends and betakes herself to sweeping
her new domain with a handful of coco-nut
bristles for a broom, thus officially acknowledging
her marriage. After cooking a great pot of
food she waits for the elusive bridegroom, who
tarries only till the sun sets, when he joyfully
returns after his voluntary exile and, alone
with his wife at last, partakes of the marriage
meal.</p>

<p>Medicine-men are regarded with great respect
by the natives. Those I have met certainly
seemed energetic and hard-working. They sit
close to the patient, massaging the seat of pain
with much vigour, and, while they are thus
rubbing, make a noise with their lips rather like
that which a groom makes when rubbing down
a horse. The process is a tiring one, and the
medicine-man stops at intervals to drink hot
water in which taro has been boiled. His
object is to extract some mysterious foreign
substance from the sick man's body, and if he
succeeds in this he receives a fee, otherwise he
gets nothing. "No cure, no pay" is apparently
the Papuan sufferer's motto.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>On one occasion a medicine-man was attending
to a patient outside a house in the village.
The natives sitting round told me he had
already extracted a pebble from one invalid and
another cure was about to take place. I expressed
a wish to see the next stone which
should be removed, and waited patiently while
the medicine-man rubbed on. At last he
stopped and, with clenched fist, called upon
me to watch. This I did, and he slowly opened
his hand and, disclosing an empty palm, cried
triumphantly, "It is gone!"</p>

<p>The natives were much impressed, but I must
say I should have preferred one glimpse of the
magic cause of disease before it vanished.</p>

<p>The weather in Papua is divided into two
seasons only&mdash;wet and dry. The former is the
summer, the latter the winter, but very little
difference in temperature is noticeable. During
the wet season thunderstorms may be expected,
and some of these are truly terrible. I have
seen even a white man look alarmed as
great claps of thunder, following on vivid
flashes of lightning, seemed to be cleaving
asunder the roof over our heads. When
to these are added strong wind and sheets of
driving rain, the situation becomes distinctly
unpleasant.</p>

<p>Like all savage races the Papuans have many
superstitions, which appear to vary according to
the tribe. The Wedauans, for example, had a
belief that most of the unseen spirits around
them were actively malignant.</p>

<p>There was a certain kind of eel which must
not be eaten, or probably a disastrous flood
would follow, while if a native wanted to cut
down a tree he had to beware lest there was a
<em>kokome</em> (dryad) living in it. If the <em>kokome</em> were
annoyed it might cause the offender's face to
swell and his skin to prick.</p>

<p>One of the worst possible offences against
hidden powers was breaking a "tabu." "Tabu"
was placed on all sorts of things&mdash;perhaps a
certain coco-nut palm, or across a path. It was
usually made of two upright sticks, with a crosspiece,
on which were hung coco-nut leaf and
husk. This was called an "iribubu," and was
safeguarded by an incantation. It took a very
reckless man or woman to disregard an
"iribubu," for unless the enchanter was willing
to accept a bribe he would not remove the
charm, and the victim, so the natives thought,
must die.</p>

<p>A witch I knew lost her husband, and his
death was put down to his wife's machinations.
Nevertheless, the polite Papuan women came to
blend their voices with the wailing of the newly-made
widow. In a few years, spite of her
uncanny reputation, the witch-widow became a
wife once more. Her second husband must
have been a brave man, or possibly he was a
sorcerer, and intended to counteract his wife's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
powers with more potent charms than her
own.</p>

</div>

<p>In Wedau, directly anyone died, the house
filled with wailing men and women, some of
whom were paid mourners. Crying had to continue
until after the funeral, and was extremely
painful to listen to.</p>

<p>Marriage takes place early in Papua, so it was
quite possible to have great-grandparents or
children weeping at the grave. Imagine a
whole family tree, with its collateral branches,
all lifting their voices at once and with much
energy, and you have a feeble idea of what a
death in Wedau involved. The mourners
usually called on the dead man by the relationship
they bore to him, and seldom mentioned
his name. After burial, in fact, the
name was "popola," and must not be spoken.
A small boy who was staying with me on a
visit told me most emphatically that he must
leave at once if I so much as mentioned the
name of his dead grandfather.</p>

<p>At one of the villages up the coast a
curious custom prevails. The mission girls
and I went to witness the funeral of an old
man. In the middle of the house, on the
floor, the deceased lay in state. The poor
old man's face was exposed to view, and was
a ghastly sight, for the kinsfolk had rouged its
cheeks, possibly to give it a semblance of life!</p>

<p>After some time spent in wailing, the procession
proceeded to the grave. As the corpse
was about to be placed in it the village policeman
glanced at me, and requested to know
whether I thought the grave was deep enough!
It seems he had been required by the Government
to superintend the digging of graves, and
wished a foreigner's approval of the way he had
fulfilled his task. What would have happened if
I had suggested delaying the funeral to dig
deeper, however, I shudder to think.</p>

<p>When I first went out to Papua there were
only five other white women on the north-east
coast, though there were a few at Samarai, the
port. Naturally life under these conditions was
very different from that in civilized countries.
Roads there were none; but as we generally
walked along the beach, or went by boat, this
did not much matter, and there were a few
tracks along which we walked in single file,
with tall reeds or grass rising perhaps to
six feet on either side of us. Gloves were
unnecessary, and even veils were too hot to
be worn. The best time of the day was
the evening, though the early morning was
deliciously cool. The Wedauans rose at an
unearthly hour, and I have heard an astonished
visitor at about 7 a.m. ask, "Is she ill?"
on hearing that I was still in bed. But
though we got up as a rule before seven
we found a rest at midday almost imperative.
My days went quietly and quickly
enough. Sellers of edible ants, coco-nuts, and
other foodstuffs came when it suited them or
when they required tobacco, and patients who
were receiving treatment usually arrived about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
9 a.m. Then I could settle down to translation
work, while the boy and girl boarders busied
themselves in the garden or fished in the sea.
In the afternoon we had school in the village
for two hours, followed by classes or visiting the
natives in their homes. They were most cordial,
and would often make me a present of a sticky
piece of taro or a fibrous sweet potato picked
steaming out of the big earthenware pot. We
all sat on the shingly floor, though perhaps I was
given a mat to spread under me, and we would
talk of pigs, crops, babies, and other matters
till after service it was time for me to return to
the house. It was not very exciting, but certainly
a very happy life.</p>

<p>We tried the experiment of keeping sheep,
but for various reasons, such as the presence of
spear grass and attacks from village dogs or pigs,
were compelled to give it up. Still, while we
had them it was possible to taste fresh mutton
occasionally, and I remember one of the lady
missionaries coming in great glee to her
fellow-workers. "Hurrah!" she cried. "A
lamb has had sunstroke; we shall have fresh
meat."</p>

<p>Fowls have always been difficult to rear, as
there is little a village dog will not force his way
through when he knows of their existence. On
one occasion one of these daring animals killed
a mission fowl in broad daylight, only to be
immediately shot by a watchful missionary. We
ate the fowl that night, while the villagers feasted
royally on the dog. So, in spite of the double
catastrophe, nothing was wasted.</p>

<p>Though cannibalism is still practised among
the inland tribes, and even occasionally on the
islands adjacent to the mainland, the coastal
natives have to be content nowadays with pigs'
flesh. They are very fond of giving feasts, and
the last photograph shows a group of feast-givers
decorated for the occasion, with gay
feathers stuck in their fuzzy hair, which is teased
out with a comb something like a many-pronged
wooden toasting-fork. They hang egg cowrie
shells on their arms, putting on all the finery
they possess, and smearing their faces with
lime.</p>

<p>All this preparation often took place days
beforehand, for a feast in Papua is nothing if
not movable. It used to be announced for a
certain day, but at the appointed time all the
necessary pigs might not have been brought in,
or some expected visitors might not have arrived,
or a pig already present might have struggled
free from its bonds and have had to be hunted
for a day or two. No one ever seemed to mind
the delay, however. With well-bred calmness
they waited until everything was quite ready,
and then the feast began.</p>

<p>On one such occasion there were nearly a
thousand people present, and fifty pigs, two
thousand coco-nuts, and huge piles of taro were
distributed. The feast-givers got nothing; that
is a universal custom. The recipients likewise
neither cooked nor ate a morsel until they got
home, for it is considered good form in Papua
to eat nothing but to carry away everything,
thus practically reversing our notions of hospitality.
There was a great heap of dismembered
pigs lying on the ground, and the
presiding genius of the feast, with his assistants,
threw these violently towards the guests. Each
important man had retainers who ran forward
and bore the joint off, while the less fortunate
ones kept up a running fire of comment&mdash;identifying
a pig's head as having been the
contribution of some particular man, or reproving
the hill-folk for their awkward gait,
telling them not to fear precipices on the coast,
and so on.</p>

<p>At this particular feast one man, an ex-policeman,
lost his temper completely. As his
share of pork was thrown forward, the distributor
took the opportunity of accusing him
of certain misdemeanours. This so enraged the
accused that he sprang to his feet brandishing
a very unpleasant-looking knife about two feet
long. His friends, not much impressed, stolidly
brought him his pork and quite disregarded his
angry commands to throw it away. Finally he
subsided, muttering. In earlier days this would
have been, no doubt, but the prelude to a very
lively little battle, and spears would soon have
been in action. The culprit, however, had
served under Government, and knew what
power it possessed to punish offenders.</p>

<p>Being some exciting incidents of forty years' service with one of the finest corps of frontiersmen
in the world&mdash;the Texas Rangers. Born horsemen and Indian fighters, in the early days they were
the sole representatives of law and order on the border, combining the functions of policemen,
magistrates, and, very often, executioners as well.</p></div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i0073dc.jpg" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> forty years from 1855 to 1895
were strenuous years for me. A
mere boy almost, just turned
eighteen, I emigrated to Texas in
the former year, and being a good
shot with rifle and revolver, and owning a good
horse, I joined the Ranger force, having nothing
else to do. For two score of eventful years I
spent the best part of every day in the saddle,
taking part in some of the most dramatic,
tragic, and nerve-trying episodes of frontier life.</p>

<p>Those were exciting times indeed. There was
but little law in West Texas during the first half
of those forty years, and the Rangers exercised
far more power and authority than at the present
day. The State was full of savage Indians and
renegade Mexicans, as well as "bad men" from
the other States of the American Union.</p>

<p>The Rangers were chosen with very great care.
A man must be brave, of good character,
preferably unmarried, a good shot, a good horseman,
and must be possessed of a horse worth
not less than a hundred dollars. He must
be absolutely fearless of danger, and prepared
to give his life at any time in enforcing
the law and in the protection of the settlers on
the frontier and their families. The Rangers had
to deal with wild, vicious, lawless characters and
criminals, Indians, Mexicans, and outlaws from
other States&mdash;all of them men who would fight
to the death rather than surrender. Of necessity,
therefore, the Rangers had to carry things with a
high hand, often passing sentence on captured
criminals and executing them without the ceremony
of a trial.</p>

<p>From 1855 to 1870 the Rangers were chiefly
employed in ridding Texas of the Comanche
Indians, incidentally keeping Mexican desperadoes
from crossing the border and protecting
the stage-coaches which carried the United
States mail, in all of which work they had the
hearty assistance of the United States troops
stationed at the different forts in Western Texas.
Every Ranger felt it his duty to live up to the
reputation which the corps had gained for fearlessness
and untiring perseverance in hunting
down criminals. Thus it was that the Texas
Rangers have been for generations the most
dreaded set of law officers in the South-West
among malefactors.</p>

<p>In the year 1856, soon after coming to Texas,
I was at Fort Inge, in the employ of the United
States Government as a scout. That year a mail
route was opened between San Antonio and El
Paso, six hundred miles distant. The contract
for delivering the mail was let to Captain William
Wallace, an old Texas Ranger and Mexican War
veteran, and six mounted guards were furnished
by the Government to accompany the coach. The
Rangers were generally selected for this dangerous
duty because they knew the State better than the
United States cavalry. For two years I was one
of these guards. Our route lay through the
wildest part of the State, where we were exposed
to attacks from Indians and outlaws all the way.
We had numberless fights with Indians and
many narrow escapes. Two of the guards were
killed during the year 1856 by Indians, who
shot them from behind clumps of cactus. We
rode close behind the mail coach, to prevent the
Indians cutting us off from the stage, and capturing
the loose mules which we always took
along for service in case of accident.</p>

<p>The prettiest fight we had with redskins on
any of these trips was at the crossing of Devil's
River. This is a deep, rocky stream, with very
high bluffs, a good place for Indians to make an
attack. The west bank was much higher than
the east bank, and crowned with trees and large
boulders. We stopped on the east bank one
day at noon to eat our lunch, and were just
ready to cross and continue our journey when
twenty-seven Indians attacked us from the west
bluffs, keeping themselves well hidden among
the rocks.</p>

<p>Captain Wallace ordered us to hold our fire,
knowing that the savages would presently
get bolder and come out where we could see
them better. Thinking we were cowards, they
soon began to show themselves, and the chief
was heard to say that they would come down
and scalp the white men, as we were afraid to
fight. We were all good shots and had good
rifles, which we kept ready for instant use. As
the Indians made preparations to descend the
bank, Captain Wallace made us creep under the
stage as if frightened at the arrows which came
down from the bluffs. The redskins, seeing
this, came out into the open and bunched
together in plain view. Captain Wallace now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
gave the signal to fire, and his own rifle cracked,
followed instantly by our six, and five Indians
fell and rolled down the bank a short distance
among the rocks. The remainder scattered at
once, and nothing was seen of them for some
time. They were hidden behind the rocks close
by their dead, but were afraid to risk showing
themselves. Our one volley had given them
enough of us, and they were anxious to leave,
but, according to their custom, they wished to
carry their dead warriors with them.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"FIVE INDIANS FELL AND ROLLED DOWN THE BANK."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Presently we saw a lasso thrown from behind
a rock and fall among the dead Indians; the
survivors were trying to rope them and drag
the bodies to cover. They threw many times,
and succeeded in catching and dragging them
all in except one. This man had fallen farther
down the bank than the others, and his arms
hung over the bluff, so that he was hard to lasso.
Loop after loop came down, and finally he was
caught under the arms and dragged away. The
Indians did not show themselves again, and at
last we harnessed up the mules, turning back
to Fort Clark to get reinforcements, as we
feared an ambuscade by a larger force. During
the fight a number of arrows hit the stage
and stuck in, and we allowed them to remain
where they were during many trips. They
were examined with a great deal of curiosity
and awe by Eastern visitors whenever we came
into San Antonio.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1870 a band of Comanches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
came raiding near Bastrop, Texas. Close to this
town lived a man named Craig, who was the
owner of a pair of fine grey horses, which, with
many others, the Indians stole. Craig was
greatly distressed about the loss of his team,
and called on his neighbours to help him recover
them, and quite a number responded,
including several friendly Indians. In the
neighbourhood lived a Tonkaway Indian named
John. He was a good trailer and fighter, and
immediately joined the party, following the trail
of the Comanches very rapidly.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the first day out we discovered
the robbers camped in a ravine. They
were cooking meat, and it was the smoke of
their camp fire which led us to their position.
We promptly charged, but the Indians discovered
us in time to make their escape, leaving
one of Craig's horses behind. We had ridden
all day with nothing to eat, so we at once proceeded
to help ourselves to the roast meat left
by the fugitives. While thus engaged we heard
a yell, and, looking round, saw a solitary warrior
on a hill, mounted on Craig's other horse.
Seeing us watching him, the Indian yelled
again and began wheeling the horse about in a
circle. He had a brand-new bridle on this horse&mdash;probably
obtained from a looted store in
Bastrop&mdash;and as he wheeled his mount rapidly
the metal on the bridle glistened in the sunshine,
although the Indian must have been a quarter of
a mile away. There was a man in the party
named Bates, who was riding a very fast horse,
and Tonkaway John said if Bates would let
him have the horse he would catch the
Comanche and bring back his scalp, together
with Craig's horse. "All right," replied Bates,
"but don't you lose my horse."</p>

<p>When the Comanche saw John coming he
galloped off across the valley, yelling defiance,
and no doubt thinking he could easily get away.
When he saw the Tonkaway gaining on him,
however, he began whipping and kicking
furiously, but it was all of no avail&mdash;Bates's horse
steadily overtook the grey. The Comanche
now strung his bow, and a battle with arrows
commenced between the two red men, but the
hostile Indian was soon stuck full of arrows and
at the mercy of John, who rode quickly up
alongside of him. They must have been fully a
mile and a half from us, but there was not a
bush or a shrub to obstruct the view, and in the
bright light of the setting sun and the clear, thin
atmosphere of the prairie we could see them as
plainly as though within two hundred yards of
them.</p>

<p>The Comanche, badly wounded, now threw
away his bow and began to beg for his life.
John, however, paid no attention to him, but
grabbed him by his long, coarse hair, pulled him
from his horse, and, dismounting, killed and
scalped him with his long knife. Remounting,
he came back yelling triumphantly, leading
Craig's horse with one hand and waving the
scalp with the other. Craig had now recovered
both his horses, so he was profuse in his thanks,
and never finished talking about the bravery of
Tonkaway John.</p>

<p>In a fight we had with Indians on the Upper
Brazos River, in the year 1876, we captured a
big Comanche chief named Black Wolf. We
took him to Fort Griffin, intending to turn him
over to the colonel commanding, but he refused
to have anything to do with the prisoner. As he
was one of the most bloodthirsty Indians on the
frontier, however, the officer recommended us to
shoot him. None of us fancied the job, and
as some friendly Tonkaways, who had been in
this fight, had a special grudge against the
Comanche, he was turned over to them to be
killed, although we little thought at the time
how they proposed to carry out the death-sentence.</p>

<p>There were about twenty of the Tonkaways,
armed with bows and arrows, and they took
the chief&mdash;a Herculean fellow&mdash;and turned him
loose in front of the fort. Then they began
shooting at him from all sides. They had to
be careful, however, not to miss him and shoot
some of their own men, so for this reason it was
not safe to shoot very strongly. The first arrow
that struck the big Indian he pulled out, and
rushed about here and there with it, trying to
stab his enemies as they shot at him. The
greater the number of arrows that struck him
the more furious he became, and the faster he
ran the more difficult it was for the archers to
hit him. The Comanche was tall, with long,
powerful arms, and could reach far with his
curious weapon, and very soon it began to
look as though he would put the whole band
of Tonkaways to flight with only an arrow.
They rushed around frantically, uttering
shrill cries of rage, trying hard to kill the big
chief, but being careful to keep out of reach of
his long arms. While this went on we stood
around the gate of the fort with the soldiers,
watching the absorbingly interesting fight. The
Comanche was soon stuck full of arrows, but
they did not penetrate deeply and did not interfere
in the least with his fighting powers. Presently
he had most of the Tonkaways on the
run, those in front trying to get out of the way
of the arrow in his hands, those at his back and
sides endeavouring to kill him without wounding
any of their comrades. Springing this way and
that he wounded several of the Tonkaways,
and our captain began to fear he would kill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
some of them, so the colonel at the fort sent
several soldiers out to drive the Tonkaways
away. The Comanche was afterwards shot.
Spite of the chief's terrible record, one could
not help admiring his pluck, and his last battle
was the bravest fight for life I have ever seen
put up by a lone Indian.</p>

<p>During the time I was a Ranger, most of the
Indians in Texas, whether hostile or friendly,
were cannibals. The hostiles were probably
greater cannibals than the friendlies, as association
with white men had a restraining influence
on the latter, but we had no opportunity to
observe the hostile Indians as we could the
friendlies. The Indians friendly to us, and who
aided us at times in our wars with the Comanches,
were the Tehuacanas, the Tonkaways, the Karankawas,
and the Lipans; the Tonkaways and
Lipans were especially friendly. But they were
all more or less cannibals by instinct and
practice, and it was only on account of the
restraining influence of the white men that they
did not indulge this revolting practice more
often. No matter how friendly they were to us,
and no matter how emphatically they were
forbidden to eat
their enemies,
there were times
when it seemed
the Indians
simply must give
way to their
natural appetites
and indulge in a
cannibal feast,
followed by a
scalp-dance.</p>

<p>Some few of
the Ranger captains
were not
so strict in this
regard as their
colleagues, allowing
the Indian
allies to do more
or less as they
pleased with their
slain enemies
after a battle in
which they had
shown unusual
bravery. But
while our captain
was glad to have
the assistance of
the friendlies, he
drew the line
sharply when it
came to allowing
them to indulge their cannibal instincts while
under his command. In 1879 there was a fight,
known as the Battle of Lost Valley, between
our company of Rangers and the Comanches,
where we were assisted by some friendly Tehuacanas
and Tonkaways. The Comanches outnumbered
us four to one, and the fight was hot
and furious. The friendly Indians became much
excited, and it was hard to restrain them. The
Comanches were routed after many fierce hand-to-hand
encounters. One of their braves was
especially daring, wounding four of the Tehuacanas
before he dropped dead&mdash;shot full of
arrows, but fighting as long as he could cling to
his horse. After the battle we were too busy
attending to the wounds of our men to give
attention to the friendlies until our captain
noticed a pair of Indian hands tied to the saddle
of one of the Tehuacana braves. He was the
Indian who had finally killed the brave
Comanche, and his trophies were the hands
of the dead warrior.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with those?"
asked our captain, sternly, pointing to the gory
souvenirs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"Goin' to eat 'em. Maybe so make me
brave," replied the Tehuacana.</p>

<p>"You rascal! If you don't drop them instantly
I'll have you shot," thundered the
captain, and very reluctantly the Tehuacana
relinquished the hands.</p>

<p>The Tehuacanas say that the first member of
their race was brought into the world by a wolf.
"How am I to live?" asked the Tehuacana.
"The same as we do," said the wolf, and that
is just about how they have lived. The braver
the enemy they slew in battle, the more liable
they were to eat him, or, at least, want to do so,
believing that this act would add to their own
pluck.</p>

<p>After 1875 Indians became very scarce in
Western Texas. They had been removed to
the Indian Territory, north of Texas, partly by
the United States soldiers and the Rangers, and
partly by the gradual and inevitable advance of
civilization. They were located on reservations
in the Territory, and a strenuous endeavour
was made by the Indian Agents and the United
States troops to keep them there, but it was
impossible to prevent small bands from crossing
the border and descending suddenly and
unexpectedly upon the scattered settlements in
Texas to steal horses, loot stores, burn houses,
and murder defenceless women and children.
As the number of Indians grew smaller, however,
they confined themselves more and more
to prowling around on dark nights and stealing
horses. Ostensibly they were now at peace
with the white men, but having been run
out of Texas mainly by the Rangers, the
grievance rankled in their bosoms, and they
occasionally came back in small squads and
straggling parties on horse-stealing expeditions.
If they could get away with a man's saddle-horse
without fighting the owner they preferred to do
so, but if necessary they were ready to fight.</p>

<p>The white settlers were so aggravated by
having their horses stolen that they resorted to
all sorts of expedients to keep the Indians from
getting them. The savages, however, kept up
their thieving excursions till there were no
horses left in some neighbourhoods, especially
near rivers, down which the Indians came from
the north and north-west, under cover of the
timber along the waterside. If they could not
get away with a horse, they would kill it rather
than leave it alive to its owner. The settlers
built strong log stables, with stout doors, which
they fastened from the inside, climbing out
themselves through a hole in the roof. Still,
with wonderful cunning, the Indians got the
horses, or killed them by shooting them with
arrows through the cracks between the logs.</p>

<p>A friend of mine with whom I often stopped
in South-West Texas told me how, on one occasion,
the Indians got two fine horses from him
when there seemed absolutely no chance for
them to be stolen. He had a stable made of
heavy oak logs, with a stout door fastened by a
strong wooden pin, which one of his grown sons
drove in with a maul on this particular evening,
having seen Indian signs in the neighbourhood
that day. Then the settler and his sons went to
sleep in the hay-loft, under the same roof, with
their loaded guns beside them. Not a sound
disturbed them during the night, but when
morning came the stable door was open and the
horses gone. The Indians had found how the
door was fastened and, by steady perseverance,
succeeded in working the pin out. Probably
the job took them hours, but they had plenty of
time.</p>

<p>Old frontiersmen are the most superstitious
class of people in the world. They all believe
in omens and portents, things that forebode
death and disaster. Their lives are spent amid
dangerous surroundings, and they are suspicious
of everything that seems unusual or ominous,
and often attach uncanny significance to things
which would make no impression upon the
ordinary citizen living in a peaceful community.</p>

<p>One of the surest signs of approaching death
to the old plainsman and Indian fighter is the
scream of the "death-bird." The "death-bird"
is supposed to fly about at night or hover near
white men or women and children to give
warning of the approach of Indians, wild beasts,
or other great dangers. Its cry is the most
piercing, nerve-racking wail that ever smote
upon human ears. There is an almost human
expression in it, as though it were the scream of
a woman or child in mortal fear; and there is
no mistaking its note among all the other night-birds
of the plains. It never warns people unless
there is no possible escape by other means, and
woe to the man who hears its cry and heeds it
not. As far as I have been able to discover no
human eye has ever looked upon this mysterious
"death-bird," for it flies only on dark nights,
never uttering its warning at any other time, and
the folk it honours with its attentions are thrown
into such a state of fear, expectancy, and dread
that curiosity as to the appearance of the bird is
far from their thoughts. It is supposed, however,
to be an owl, black as midnight, with very
long wings and a large head and mouth, which
superstitious people who claim to have seen the
creature declare to be strangely like the head
and mouth of a human being.</p>

<p>Almost every old Ranger and frontiersman
has a weird story to tell as to the "death-bird"
having saved the life of someone or other from
Indians or outlaws. Most of the stories, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
are second-hand narratives, and I found when
they had been sifted down they had almost
always happened to someone other than the
narrator. It was extremely rare that they were
personal experiences, and they generally happened
in some distant part of the State at some
remote time. I had been a Ranger twenty
years before I met a man, in whom I had the
utmost confidence, who had a personal experience
to relate wherein the "death-bird" had
warned him of danger and saved his life. Up
to this time I had doubted the truthfulness of
these stories, and scouted the idea that such
a bird existed. About seven years after this my
friend, in company with two
other Rangers, was ambushed
and killed one night by
renegade Mexicans down on
the Rio Grande border, and
on this occasion there was
no "death-bird" to save his
life, so I was still a little
dubious.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>MR. ISAAC MOTES, WHO HERE RELATES SOME
OF THE MOST EXCITING EXPERIENCES HE HAD
DURING FORTY YEARS' SERVICE AS A TEXAS RANGER.</p>

<p><em>From a Photograph.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Three years later, however,
I met with an adventure
which removed the last vestige
of doubt from my mind. In
the autumn of 1880, with five
other Rangers, under command
of a lieutenant, I was
stationed at Eagle Pass, on
the Rio Grande. About the
middle of November I was
sent to San Antonio with
important despatches for the
colonel commanding. I was
selected for the trip because
I had the fleetest horse of
any man in the force, a big
black thoroughbred, for which
I had paid three hundred
dollars when he was only
two years old, and at a time, too, when horseflesh
was cheap. For three years I had ridden
this horse daily on all our scouting expeditions.
He had borne me safely through many dangers,
and I loved him almost as if he had been a
human being.</p>

<p>I left San Antonio on my return one morning
at eleven o'clock and rode seventy miles by nine
o'clock that night, arriving at the Nueces River
and Turkey Creek bottoms. The weather
became threatening in the afternoon, and at
night dense clouds obscured the light from the
stars, and as there was no moon it became so
appallingly black when we entered the thick
timber of the "bottoms" that I could not see
an inch before my eyes, and even my horse
could not find his way around the trees, bushes,
and fallen timber. There was no rain, no
lightning, no thunder, and no wind&mdash;simply a
thick pall of clouds which seemed to rest upon
the tops of the trees&mdash;while a curious soft murmuring
sound seemed to come from the bottom
lands. I would have stopped immediately upon
reaching the timber, but I had heard that afternoon
that Indians had been seen along the river
within the past twenty-four hours, and I had
noticed the trail of what I believed to be Indian
ponies crossing my road about six o'clock. So
somehow or other I felt my way through the
pitch-darkness till we were perhaps three
hundred yards from the edge of the Nueces
bottom. Then, dismounting,
I took off my saddle and,
letting down my lariat, looped
the end around my left wrist
so that my horse could graze,
and yet waken me if he got
too far away. Lying down
under a large live-oak with
my head on the saddle, I
soon went to sleep with the
subdued murmuring sound
still echoing in my ears. I
intended to rest a few hours,
until the clouds lifted, and
then continue my journey to
a settlement twenty miles
farther on. The tree under
which I lay was a very large
one, and I found next morning
that the top limbs were
dead, the tree having been
struck by lightning some
years before.</p>

<p>I must have slept for some
time, but it seemed to me my
eyes had barely closed when
a piercing, wailing scream in
the tree above me brought
me instantly to my feet&mdash;a scream so startling
that it seemed to vibrate every nerve in my body.
Even if I had never heard so much as a whisper
as to the peculiar character of the "death-bird's"
cry I should have recognised it, for never before
or since have I heard such a wild, foreboding
shriek. The cry was long and wailing&mdash;the first
note sharp, like the crack of a six-shooter, then
trailing off into a long-drawn-out, ominous wail.
The bird was doubtless sitting on one of the
dead limbs above me, and at the first note of
alarm had flown off across the bottom, the cry
becoming more weird and portentous the farther
away it got.</p>

<p>I took notice of this in a kind of subconscious
way, for my faculties were strung to their
highest tension to discover the danger that I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
convinced menaced me. Even before the cry died
away I heard my horse drawing in its breath in
a sort of sob, as though uneasy and somewhat
excited. Then I noticed that the lariat looped
to my wrist was drawn suspiciously tight. This
impression had hardly formed in my mind before
the lariat suddenly drew a little tighter, then
slackened perceptibly. Instantly it occurred to
me that an Indian was out there with my horse,
that he had the lariat in his hand, and was perhaps
running his hand along it towards me to
untie it, thinking it was tied to a stake, when,
having got near enough to hear me as I sprang
to my feet, he cut the line with a knife, causing
the momentary tightness, followed by the
slackening.</p>

<p>The thought that an Indian was making off
with my valuable horse so filled me with fury that
I was driven almost to desperation, and forgot for
an instant the necessity for caution. Slipping
the looped lariat off my wrist, I drew my six-shooter
and crept as softly as I could out in the
direction of my horse. I could still hear him
sniffing out there in the brush, and thought I
heard him stepping among sticks as though he
was being led away. This so enraged me that
I pushed through the brush faster and more
recklessly than ever, gripping my six-shooter,
though I realized I was doing a foolhardy thing,
for an Indian can see in the dark much better
than a white man. Still, it seemed impossible
for me to resist the impulse to pursue my
horse.</p>

<p>I had groped my way perhaps twenty feet
when I stepped on to some dry twigs, which
cracked sharply under my weight. Simultaneously
I heard the ominous throb of a heavy
bow-string, and as I ducked my head, quick as
thought, an arrow took off my hat and tore
through my hair, scorching my scalp as though a
red-hot iron rod had been laid across my head.
Upon this my horse became so excited that he
began to rear, plunge, and snort. I stood
irresolute, fearing to fire in that direction lest
I should kill the animal. From the sound
the horse was making I believed he was
pulling considerably on the halter and backing
towards me. While I stood there, in a fever of
uncertainty, I again heard the dull hum of the
bow-string and ducked to avoid the arrow, but
instead of its coming toward me there was a
wild, almost human, cry from my horse, and he
reared and fell heavily to the ground, then
staggered to his feet again and came towards
me, uttering the most agonizing cry that ever
tortured human ears. When perhaps ten feet
from me he again fell and lay still, moaning
with pain. A mad fury of rage possessed me
at my beauty's agony, and I leaped blindly
forward in the darkness, not caring whether I
lived or died if only I could kill that brute of an
Indian. I made towards where I heard my horse
fall, feeling for him with my left hand, and just as
I touched him I heard once more the twang of
the Indian's bow-string, and again an arrow
whizzed at me, tearing away the lobe of my ear.
In ducking this time I sank to my knees and
found myself between my dead horse's fore and
hind legs as he lay with his belly towards me,
with my left hand resting on his body. I
marked carefully the direction of the bow-string's
hum, and as my knees touched the ground I
raised myself up and fired twice in quick succession,
afterwards sinking down low again
behind the horse's body.</p>

<p>There was no sound from the redskin to lead
me to believe I had struck him, so I crouched
down between the feet of my dead horse,
gripping my six-shooter, expecting the Indian or
Indians to be upon me every minute. But
minutes and hours passed, and still I heard not
the faintest sound from that direction. Nevertheless,
I dared not move, but spent the remainder
of the night where I was, protected by
the animal's body.</p>

<p>As the grey light of coming day began to steal
into the bottom I peered anxiously around me,
searching for signs of the Indian, either dead or
alive. I could see nothing of him through the
bushes and vines, so when it became light I got
up and walked cautiously in the direction from
which the arrows had come. About fifty yards
away I discovered traces of blood, and following
these for a short distance I found where the
Indian had lain down and dragged himself,
leaving a plainly discernible trail. Following
this for about three hundred yards farther I
came to a tiny little gully about a foot deep.
In one place the limbs of a low tree overhung
it, and here the gully appeared to be nearly full
of leaves. Looking about, I saw what I took
to be an arrow sticking up above the leaves. I
approached very cautiously, watching for the
slightest movement, but there was none, and
the arrow still stuck out at an angle of about
forty-five degrees. Six-shooter in hand I drew
nearer, and found an Indian lying there dead in
the gully. It was obvious what had happened.
Becoming too weak to crawl, my enemy had
stretched himself in this gully, raked the dead
leaves over his body, covering himself from view
very artfully, and then, with bow and arrow,
ready to shoot me if I had followed him and
overtook him while he was yet alive, he had
lain there, bearing the pain of his wounds with
stoical fortitude, until death came to his release.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>MR. F. HARRIS DEANS, WHO HERE RELATES AN
AMUSING EXPERIENCE THAT BEFELL HIM IN HUNGARY.</p>

<p><em>From a Photograph.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>The only person&mdash;at one time I had regarded
him as a friend&mdash;to whom I have hitherto nerved
myself to recount my experience regarded it as
an excuse&mdash;nay, more than
an excuse, an incentive&mdash;for
mirth. The thoughtful reader,
however, who now becomes
acquainted with my story will,
I feel confident, place himself
in imagination in my position,
so that his perusal of
this article will, at all events,
enable him to refrain from
ribald laughter.</p>

<p>I will confess at the outset
that my knowledge of Hungarian
is limited to some
dozen words. The time of day
I will pass with you in the
most fluent Ungarisch; if you,
enraptured at my accent, wish
to continue the conversation,
and will confine yourself to
remarking that the weather is
hot or cold (you must not say
warm or chilly), I will agree,
or disagree, with you&mdash;curtly,
maybe, but nevertheless I will
do so; if you are thirsty I will order you wine,
beer, or water; your hunger I will satisfy with
bread. Further, I can amuse, instruct, and
elevate you by counting up to ten.</p>

<p>The reader who himself possesses some
knowledge of Hungarian will share with me my
admiration of my linguistic accomplishments.
It takes some years of patient efforts for an
Hungarian himself to learn his own language.
I feel confident, had I been so fortunate (I am
writing this in the heart of Hungary, and the
inhabitants are an impulsive people) as to have
been born an Hungarian, I should have borne
dumbness with equanimity.</p>

<p>All this&mdash;though, to the broad-minded, it
excuses my ignorance of the language&mdash;does
not alter the fact that I was fully aware beforehand
that in certain regions of the country I
should not be able to enjoy heart-to-heart talks
with the people. Even in England there are
whole villages which speak no tongue save their
native one. I did not, however, anticipate that
my ignorance would land me
in the weird adventure here
set forth.</p>

<p>In a town, however, such
as Arad I did not anticipate
that there would exist one
miserable, imbecile, uneducated
incompetent&mdash;who, alas,
only knows my opinion of him
through a far too polite interpreter&mdash;who
spoke only his
own language, and that this
one disreputable outcast and
disgrace to an educated nation
should cross my path.</p>

<p>I arrived in Arad&mdash;a town
of about sixty thousand
people, lying near the
Roumanian border&mdash;at about
2 a.m. I had not slept for
over thirty-six hours, and I
was so tired that I would
have shared a bed with a
Roumanian peasant. Can I
say more?</p>

<p>At the nearest hotel I pulled myself together
and demanded, in what was, under the circumstances,
very tolerable German, a bedroom.
There was no difficulty about this; there was a
room vacant. Gladly I filled in particulars of
myself on the Police Form as the law demands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you an Austrian or a German?" inquired
the porter.</p>

<p>I glanced at him sharply; I was in no mood
for sarcasm. Besides, if it came to that, <em>his</em>
German wasn't of much account. But no; his
face was gravity itself; courteous curiosity was
its only expression. I pointed&mdash;I had no mind
to risk my reputation as a linguist by further
speech&mdash;to the form I had just filled in.</p>

<p>"London," he read. "So, ein Englander?"</p>

<p>"<i lang="de">Ja</i>," said I.</p>

<p>I got into bed at 2.30 a.m., and immediately
fell last asleep.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"ONCE MORE THE IDIOT MET ME WITH AN AMIABLE GRIN."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Some time later I awoke and sat up with
a start. Thump,
thump, thump&mdash;blows
rained
steadily, monotonously,
on my door.
I switched on the
light; it was 3.30
a.m. Springing out
of bed, I threw open
my door. The
interrupter of my
repose, apparently
resting against it
after his exertions,
fell forward into the
room and trod on
my bare toes. I
called him, in German,
a clumsy
donkey, and
demanded to know
what all of the noise
was about. By way
of reply he grinned
at me amiably&mdash;as
if we had a little
joke in common&mdash;and
promptly retreated.</p>

<p>Puzzled by his
behaviour, I looked
along the corridor.
Everything appeared
to be all right, so I retired again to bed.</p>

<p>Seven minutes, by my watch, had I been
sleeping dreamlessly, when again that tattoo was
beaten on my door. I nearly choked with
anger, and, throwing off my quilt, I dashed
madly to the door.</p>

<p>Once more the idiot met me with an amiable
grin.</p>

<p>"You confounded fool!" I roared, shaking
my fist in his beaming face; "what do you
think you're doing? Even if this is an Hungarian
game, do you think this is the time to start
teaching it to a stranger? Your intentions may
be good; I admit I am lonely; perhaps in the
afternoon I may be glad to play some simple
little game with you. But not now. Do you
understand? Not at three in the morning.
Get!"</p>

<p>My vivacity appeared to cause him much satisfaction,
and he again took his departure.</p>

<p>I returned to bed.</p>

<p>This time I didn't even succeed in getting to
sleep; he must have been waiting round the
corner. Once more he beat upon my door.</p>

<p>I made no attempt to speak to him; I could
not have expressed my feelings even in English;
I seized him by the
shoulders (luckily he
was a good-tempered
man) and shook
him. Apparently,
judging from the
sound, I had shaken
him to pieces. I
looked on the ground
and saw that he had
dropped&mdash;my boots!
This restored my
speech. "Boots!"
I shrieked, as he
picked them up and
politely offered them
to me. "I want
peace, not boots.
Have I as much as
mentioned boots to
you? Does any sane
man want his boots
at three o'clock?
Do you think I sleep
in them? Do you
imagine that's what's
keeping me awake,
not having them?"</p>

<p>I think it was the
man's perfect
placidity that made
me so mad. Had
he lost <em>his</em> temper,
had he only sworn in Hungarian&mdash;a language
admirably suited for the art, by the way&mdash;I
should have felt better. But no; he maintained
a perfect silence; he appeared to regard me as
a lunatic on whom speech would be wasted.
Realizing at last, however, that I was not yearning
at that moment for my boots, he put them
on one side&mdash;to be introduced again at a more
suitable moment. Next he pointed to my
pyjamas.</p>

<p>"What about them?" I demanded, furiously.
"What's wrong with them? Is it the colour, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
what?" As a matter of fact they looked rather
neat&mdash;a sort of chocolate with blue stripes. In
any case, I didn't want to be awakened in the
middle of the night to have a boots tell me he
didn't admire my pyjamas. They weren't meant
to be admired; they were intended to be slept
in. I wished he would realize that.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would rather I wore a night-shirt,"
I continued, as he remained speechless.
"Well, I'm not going to. I'm an Englishman,
Englander, Angol&mdash;do you understand?&mdash;and
I'll wear what I like. Now I'm going to bed
again. If I so much as hear you breathe near
my door before nine o'clock I'll shoot you."
With that I retired and slammed the door.</p>

<p>I was half-way towards the bed when the door
opened and boots inserted his head. Then
a hand followed, and he scratched his head
in a puzzled manner. Words, I felt, were
wasted on him. In as dignified a manner as
possible I climbed into bed and switched off
the light hanging over it. Immediately boots
turned on the light near the door. I sat up,
indignant.</p>

<p>"Look here," I said, "I've had enough of it."
I raised a cautioning forefinger. "I will <em>not</em>
play games with you. Understand that, once
for all. Go and wake somebody else up&mdash;somebody
who knows these national customs of
yours. I'm speaking seriously now. When I
engaged this room I engaged it to sleep in.
Sleep! Do you understand? It's an English
custom. You're wasting your time trying to
talk to me. I don't understand your language,
and I'm not going to learn&mdash;not immediately,
anyhow. Now, go! Go, you&mdash;&mdash;!" As I
rushed at him he turned and fled, and, locking
the door, for the fifth time that night I got into
bed.</p>

<p>I was by this time in such a mood that I was
awakened with a start at four o'clock by the
sound of whispering outside my door. Without
stopping to consider how I should dispose of
the corpse of my intended victim, I again
vacated my bed. This time boots was accompanied
by another person, who turned out to be
the manager.</p>

<p>"I hev' come to apologize," he remarked,
blandly.</p>

<p>I struggled to regain my composure.</p>

<p>"This is too good of you," I said, warmly.
"Come in and take a seat."</p>

<p>He misunderstood my sarcasm and promptly
entered, accompanied by the boots.</p>

<p>"Zere have been a leetle mistake," he continued,
with an amused smile I made no effort
to share.</p>

<p>"It's more than kind of you," I said, gratefully,
"to come and wake me up at four in the
morning to explain it."</p>

<p>He bowed modestly. Personal convenience,
he assured me earnestly, was as nothing to an
act of courtesy.</p>

<p>Then he explained. It appeared that the
previous occupier of my room had been a
German, who had intended to take his departure
at three o'clock that morning. At the last
moment, however, he had changed his mind,
and had left at 11 p.m. Unfortunately, the
porter, whom he had desired to instruct the
boots to awaken him, had forgotten to cancel
the order.</p>

<p>"Und he had sayed he vos a ver' heafy
sleeper!" he wound up. "So you see, it vos a
mutual misunderstanding. Nicht was?"</p>

<p>"This," I said, "makes everything satisfactory.
Now, if you don't mind, I should like
to go to sleep. I have to catch a train at ten.
Perhaps you will see that I am not awakened
before nine?"</p>

<p>When he had impressed this on the penitent
boots, we parted, with mutual expressions of
regard.</p>

<p>The boots&mdash;no doubt in a well-meant desire
to make up for his earlier mistake&mdash;this time
forbore to awaken me at all. I accordingly
awoke at midday, in plenty of time for my next
train, which left twenty-two hours later.</p>


<h3>THE HORROR IN THE PIT.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By E. F. Martin, late of the Royal Niger Company's Service.</span>
</p>

<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">I have</span> since been to a great extent cured;
but in my earlier African days, somewhere about
eleven years ago, I was full of romantic ideas
and intoxicated with the strange glamour and
mystery that pervaded everything connected
with the great Niger River and its unknown
territories. Having tied up to a bank late one
afternoon, half an hour before sunset, I took my
gun&mdash;a sporting Martini&mdash;and set out from the
little river launch, of which I was the sole white
passenger, and made my way through the long
grass skirting the banks of the stream, until I
emerged into an open, ploughed field, with its
lines of mounds about eighteen inches high,
indicating guinea-corn or yam cultivation. My
intention was to reach a backwater, some half a
mile away, which I had noticed as we steamed
up the river a short time before tying up. I
hoped I might find hippo, or, at any rate, an
alligator or two, hidden in the seclusion of this
secret byway of the great river.</p>

<p>Crossing the field I entered a kind of copse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
consisting of minor trees and scrub. Pushing
my way through I found some clearer ground,
carpeted with the gourd plant. Ahead of me
I noticed that the land suddenly dipped to a
large pool that might have been connected with
the main river. This, I thought, would do as
well as my backwater, especially as I heard just
then the distant grunting roar of a hippo. Next
moment, without warning, the solid
ground gave way under my feet,
and I went hurtling down into
black darkness, bringing up with a
tremendous shock that seemed to
jar me from tip to toe.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>MR. E. F. MARTIN, WHO HAD AN
APPALLING STRUGGLE WITH A SNAKE
AT THE BOTTOM OF A PIT.</p>

<p><em>From a Photograph.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>When I had recovered from my
utter astonishment, and had made
certain that no bones were broken,
I looked about and above me to
see where I was and what had
happened. Around and beneath
me I could see nothing; everything
was shrouded in impenetrable
blackness. Above me, however,
I saw the evening sky,
gradually fading into night. My
gun was gone. Where was I?
What had happened? Had the
earth opened and swallowed me
up?</p>

<p>I decided to strike a light and see
what kind of place I had fallen into.
The blue spurt and the flickering
flame, settling almost immediately
into a thin, steady tongue of yellow fire, revealed
to me the fact that I had fallen into some kind
of trap&mdash;probably for hippo&mdash;and that this trap
was some eight feet long by five broad and ten
deep. At the bottom, at regular intervals, were
placed pointed stakes about eighteen inches
apart. Had I fallen prone I should have been
impaled. I had apparently, then, something to
be thankful for. As this thought struck me
my match burnt the tips of my fingers and I
dropped it. As it fell something caught my eye
that froze my blood in my veins&mdash;some coiled
black thing was slowly moving in the farther
corner! Part of its body was enshrouded
in the shadow of the stakes, but I saw
sufficient to convince me that my companion
was some kind of venomous snake. Have any
of my readers known what it is to feel the heart
stop dead still, after one fierce bound into the
throat, the body go cold and clammy, like
dank, damp clay&mdash;like the earth that I leaned
up against in that moment of dumb, stricken
terror? You that have know what I felt then,
ten feet down in the bowels of the earth, imprisoned
with that coiling thing. You that have
not, pray that you never may, for it seems as
though the life is passing from one in the cold
sweat which oozes through every pore. I leant
against the side of the pit trembling like an
aspen leaf. Oh! for my gun and a steady light!
At least I could then stake all in one try for
life. My hands shaking violently, I lit another
match and glanced in the direction of the
horror. I might have spared my pains. The
brute&mdash;a long, black, shiny snake,
with a sort of hooded head&mdash;was
actually at my feet, the sinuous
body stretched across the rough
floor among the pointed stakes!</p>

<p>I stood still as though paralyzed,
the match burning like a tiny flare
in my uplifted right hand. The
snake came straight on without
striking, and as the match went
out it started to coil up my left
leg. The sensation of that strange,
gliding grip, which squeezed the
muscles as it passed along, is impossible
to describe. Up it came
in the darkness, higher and higher
still, feeling like a hawser of steel
round my body&mdash;and heavy!
Suddenly&mdash;to my dying day I shall
never forget the horror of that
moment&mdash;its cold, hard snout
touched my chin. It was just a
sort of gliding touch, with no
attempt at striking. Obeying a
mad impulse, I gripped straight for
where the neck should be, judging by the feel of
the snout on my chin, and with the strength of a
maniac my fingers closed on the snake just behind
the head. Feeling my advantage, I forced my
two thumbs deep into its throat. Then I tripped
forward in my excitement, the coils of the snake
suddenly contracting with a fierce pressure as I
strengthened my grip. Down I went, tearing
myself badly on two stakes as I fell, gashing my
right leg above the knee&mdash;the scar remains to
this day&mdash;and receiving a nasty bruise on my
left shoulder. In spite of my fall, however, I
had enough presence of mind to keep the
terrible head at arm's length, and now, once on
the ground, in spite of cuts, bruises, and the
twining coils round my arm, I got on to my
knees and banged and dashed that deadly head
on the hard earth and against the stakes I could
feel on either side. How long I kept on in my
wild, frenzied fury I don't know, but gradually
the fierce-gripping coils relaxed, until at last the
limp form hung from my bleeding hands, lifeless
and harmless.</p>

<p>I don't remember what happened then, but I
think I lost consciousness for a time. All I
know for certain is that I was hauled out of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
hole some time later&mdash;about 8 p.m., to be
exact&mdash;by two of the coloured deck-hands, who
had tracked me through the field and the
bushes, and, ultimately, to the edge of the hippo
trap. They guessed that I had fallen in, and
the lowering of a lamp that they carried proved
this to be the case. My gun lay where it had
fallen, close to the edge.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"I TRIPPED FORWARD IN MY EXCITEMENT."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Why that snake never struck me I do not
know to this day, unless it was that, seeing me
in the sudden light of the match leaning up
against the opposite wall, it had attempted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
get out of the pit&mdash;into which it also must
have dropped by accident like myself&mdash;by
using my body as a ladder. For all I know
the skeleton of the creature still lies in that
ten-foot-deep hole. I have not since been
there to inquire, nor do I intend to do so in
the future; the very thought of the place is
nightmare enough.</p>

<p>This incident occurred about four miles below
Abutshi, the trading station near Onitsha, before
one comes to the shallows that make that part of
the Niger so difficult in the dry season.</p>


<h3>THE CRUISE OF THE "CROCODILE."</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Commander R. Dowling, R.N.R. (Captain in the Imperial Ottoman Navy).</span>
</p>

<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">In</span> December, 1900, I left Port Said for
London in command of a small "hopper." For
the benefit of the uninitiated, I should explain
that this is a vessel
with a bottom which
opens out and allows
the contents of the
hold to fall into the
sea. The "hopper"
had formerly been employed
in widening the
Suez Canal, but had
since been converted
into a tank steamer
for carrying oil. I had
undertaken to bring
her to England in tow
of another steamer of
some seven thousand
tons burden.</p>

HE MADE FROM PORT SAID TO LONDON IN A "HOPPER."</p>

<p><em>From a Photo. by Apollon Studio.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>I got the crew
together with some
difficulty. When I explained
the project to
English-speaking seamen,
they all refused,
in a most emphatic
manner, to have anything
to do with it, and
in the end I had to
fall back on a number
of men to whom I was
unable to explain it
at all properly. They
were one Swede, the
mate; a Greek and a
Frenchman, whom I
understood to be
engineers; four Italian
seamen and four Greek firemen, and an Italian
cook. Excepting the Swede, who understood
English with difficulty, not one of the crew
could make out a word I said, so that during
the first part of the voyage I was compelled to
give orders to the ship's company in a kind of
pantomimic dumb-show.</p>

<p>We managed to bend on two five-inch hawsers
to the other steamer and started on our voyage,
using our own engines to assist the towing ship.
The engineer was full of zeal, which he showed
by repeatedly "ramming" our consort, through
his failure to understand the orders sent below
through the tube&mdash;we
had no telegraph&mdash;and
this, needless to say,
caused a great deal of
unpleasantness, shown
chiefly in personal
abuse of myself from
the big vessel, though
I repeatedly tried to
gesticulate explanations
as to the position.</p>

<p>The Italian cook
turned out an utter
fraud, giving repeated
proofs of his incapacity.
I endeavoured to instruct
him by practical
demonstration in the
art of boiling pork and
cabbage, but it came
on to blow and, the
sea rising rapidly as it
does in the Mediterranean,
the galley was
washed out and the
cooking difficulty disposed
of for ever, for we
had to live on cocoa,
biscuit, and onions
during nearly the
whole of that eventful
voyage.</p>

<p>The seas grew
bigger and bigger, and
the <em>Crocodile</em> rolled
horribly. Finally
we had to abandon the quarters forward for fear
of being washed overboard. I had twice tried
to get to my cabin, for I had stowed away all
the medical comforts, my sextant, cigars, and so
forth in my bunk. At the first attempt I got
knocked down and nearly had my leg broken
by a heavy sea; at the second I came as close
to being washed overboard as possible. By a
desperate effort, however, I finally got down to
my cabin, where I found everything&mdash;my clothes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
included&mdash;washing about in a depth of bilge
water and oil, while my precious sextant was
smashed. I managed to rescue the barometer&mdash;an
excellent one, lent me by the towing ship,
but useless under the circumstances&mdash;but I
was obliged to let everything else go.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"THE SEAS GREW BIGGER AND BIGGER, AND THE 'CROCODILE' ROLLED HORRIBLY."</p></div>
</div>

<p>When I clambered back on deck I found the
crew simply torpid with fright. Our two little
engines raced as we lifted in such a way as
to threaten a smash-up of the whole of the
machinery. In spite of all my threats, and even
some muscular persuasion, I was unable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
induce a single man of the crew, with the
exception of the mate, to stir. The ship, I may
remark, was an awkward one to handle; she
had no bulwarks, except a small piece forward
and aft, with a single chain in between. Bunker
lids were being continually washed off, but, as
the men were too scared to reship them, the
mate and myself had to do this ourselves to
prevent our going down.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night, the weather
growing steadily worse, one of the anchors got
adrift. By a mingling of menace and persuasion
I got one of the Italians to go forward with me
to secure it. The mate, dead beat, was lying
asleep on the engine-room gratings. We watched
our time and made a rush for it, when a
tremendous sea came over, simply burying us in
water. I smashed my left toe against a pump,
got a big piece taken out of one forefinger, and
felt blood running into my eyes from a wound
in my head. Looking round, I saw the Italian
overboard, hanging on convulsively to a rail, and
made a rush to his rescue. I managed to get
hold of him, and finally hauled him on deck&mdash;and
an awful bundle he was, having seemingly
put all the clothes he had in the world on his
back. However, we contrived to pass a lashing
round the anchor and secure it as well as could
be done under the circumstances. We were
also successful in getting back aft, though the
luckless Italian was bowled over and rolled
about beneath another heavy sea, but the clothes
he had on seemed to protect him, and he got to
the stokehold uninjured.</p>

<p>Throughout the grim days and black nights
that followed we laboured incessantly, led by the
two hawsers that held us to the other ship.
These hawsers had to be watched incessantly, and
pieces of wood kept under the places where they
came on board to prevent them from being cut.
There was not a chair, or a stool, or a dry rag
on board the ship. The crew spent their time
praying or lamenting, and when we wanted to
sleep the only place on which we could lie was
the engine-room gratings, from which we got up
as black as sweeps with coal-dust and grime.
The seas were constantly washing over us from
stem to stern, though the ship ahead had been
dropping oil for three days to make things better
for us. She herself was in difficulties, as we
could see from the seas which continually rushed
out from her water ports and scuppers.</p>

<p>About daybreak on the fourth day a loud
report sounded through the din of wind and
weather, and I saw our port hawser snap close
up to the towing ship. We were then, of course,
towing the broken part astern, and for hours I
was in dread that it would foul our propeller.
Luckily the weather moderated somewhat, and
the larger vessel eased up, endeavouring to
drop a line down to our end of the hawser so
that we might heave it aboard. Owing to the
drift to leeward, however, we found it impossible
to do anything in this way, so, after waiting
some hours longer, the towing vessel launched a
boat to bring in the end. The boat was stove
in as soon as it touched the water, and it was
hauled on board again only just in time to save
the crew from drowning. In the meantime I
started to get out one of our own small steel
boats. For four hours we laboured at this task,
for the steamer rolled so much that at one
moment the boat would be hanging over the water
quite a distance from the side, and at another
threatening to knock the funnel off. In the end
we managed to launch her, pick up the end of the
broken hawser, connect up again, and make a
fresh start. But I defy anyone who has not gone
through it to realize the labour, the difficulties,
and danger we went through. Tossed about by
mountainous seas, expecting every moment to
be capsized, to fish up a five-inch steel hawser
trailing deep below the surface, and pull back
with it to the towing vessel, is a labour the
arduousness of which my pen is utterly unable
to describe. At last we got started again, and
two days later, one lovely clear morning, we
arrived at Algiers, the first port of call on our
voyage.</p>

<p>Here the captain of the towing ship went ashore
with me to obtain two Manila hawsers, these
having more "give" and "spring" in them than
wire ropes. We ransacked Algiers in vain, and
accordingly cabled home for instructions. These
were to the effect that the "hopper" was to be
brought to England under her own steam, and I
was given twenty-four hours to decide whether I
would undertake the task. I made up my mind,
now I had got so far, to see the thing through.</p>

<p>Most of the crew had cleared off at Algiers
the moment they had the chance, and it was
with the greatest difficulty that I managed to get
another lot together. Having seen my friend
the towing ship off, I started myself two days
later for Gibraltar.</p>

<p>Scarcely had we got to sea again when we
began to encounter the same diabolical weather
as before. I made a discovery, too, that disconcerted
me more almost than anything that
we had already experienced&mdash;I found we had
no instruments! During the voyage from Port
Said all the navigation, of course, was done by
the towing vessel, and the necessity of independent
navigation, in consequence of the altered
arrangements, had never entered our heads. I
had neither a chronometer nor sextant; only a
small-scale chart and a very questionable and
erratic compass on the bridge. After much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
cogitation I found the only thing I could do
was to get the bearing of the North Star, and
this I did by laying a broomstick along the top
of the compass and pointing it as straight as
possible. By this I was able to shape a course
to Cape de Gat, the south-east corner of Spain,
making due allowance for wind and current.</p>

<p>But trouble soon began. At Algiers I had
picked up a French engineer who was in perpetual
trouble with his engines. He spoke no
English, I spoke no French; so that after
various altercations in our own languages I was
obliged to intimate to him, in a fashion it was
difficult for him to misunderstand, that further
discussions were useless. One morning, however,
when between blowing and pitching it was hard
to stand upright, the engineer came tumbling on
deck frantic with excitement, gesticulating madly
and shouting, "Monsieur le Commandant, oily,
oily!" while he pointed a quivering forefinger
below.</p>

<p>I rushed down and found the starboard
engine bearings grinding away just about red-hot
for want of oil, the stench and steam being
indescribable. I cursed him for an idiot, for he
might have known we were half full of oil, and
he promptly shut off steam. During this time
our tiny vessel (she was only a hundred and
thirty-five tons), having but little way on her,
was tossed about like a chip, and the rest of the
crew lay in a jumble in the stokehold&mdash;sick,
praying and groaning&mdash;neither persuasion nor
kicks having the least effect on them. It was
under these cheerful conditions that, having
restarted the engines, we reached Gibraltar a
day or two later.</p>

<p>The Officer of Health at Gibraltar received
my account of the voyage, first with incredulity,
and then astonishment. He heard my proposal
to navigate home under the prevailing conditions
with a stare of stupefaction, and then remarked,
significantly, "Well, rather you than me,
captain."</p>

<p>I had literally to hold the chief engineer
down at starting in order to frustrate his frantic
struggles to get overboard. We made for Cape
St. Vincent, the weather being bad, though endurable,
thence I steered for Cape Roca and
the Burlings, but made neither. Finally we
picked up Cape Finisterre and were in the Bay
of Biscay, where, sure enough, we caught it. It
blew hard from the north-west, and the vessel at
times nearly stood on end. Nevertheless, we
had to be continually shifting coal and water to
keep the propeller under water. In the middle
of the night the second engineer crawled along
to me on the bridge to tell me the piston
packings of the port engine had blown out, and
those of the other engine were leaking so badly
that they were expected to blow out also at any
moment.</p>

<p>Now, if the engine had gone, there was not a
spar or a sail of any kind on the vessel to keep
her before the wind, and our fate, had we once
been cast into the trough of the sea, would have
been certain. Accordingly we had to keep one
engine running at half speed while we patched
up the other with some valuable hose which had
been used for pumping oil out. When we had
finished one we turned to the other, and
managed to make a tolerable job of both. This
kept us going for nearly two days.</p>

<p>On the fourth day from Finisterre, about one
in the morning, we sighted a light. At first I
thought it was the coast of France, but after a
while I saw the familiar stump of the Eddystone,
and then I knew where I was. On receiving
the joyful news the crew worked up some sort
of enthusiasm, and I determined to put out to
sea again and face it. The firemen threw their
hearts into their work and we breasted the waves
gallantly. Soon, however, I heard a muffled report
and yells from the engine-room, and, rushing
below, found we had to stop the port engine for
a time; so we went on with the starboard one
pretty comfortably for about twenty-four hours,
when the repairs were roughly completed. Then
the wind rose again to almost hurricane force, and
the ship rolled and pitched quite in her best
style. Even this was not the worst, for near
Dungeness a heavy sea threw a water-tank on
top of me, and when I was hauled out I found
I had broken a bone in my left wrist, in addition
to other injuries. At that point, too, the electric
light went out. The ship was now in total
darkness; we had no mast or side-lights, and
presently, to crown all, a dense fog settled upon
us. At that moment a nautical Mark Tapley
would have been hard put to it to muster up
any cheerfulness worth mentioning.</p>

<p>However, to make an end to a long story, we
worried through our troubles somehow or other,
got a pilot on board, and at last arrived off the
Royal Albert Docks, where very thankfully we
made fast to the Galleon buoys on December
22nd. To show one difficulty I had to contend
with during this ever-memorable voyage
I may mention that the compass was so untrue
that to make a true east course I had to steer
south a quarter west.</p>

<p>For ten days after our arrival I was laid up
and unable to get off to the ship. When I did
I found that nearly the whole of my things had
been stolen. I received from the owners, in
recognition of the danger and arduousness of
the voyage, a gratuity of ten pounds!</p>

<p>In various parts of Europe the simple peasant-folk observe some extraordinary customs&mdash;strange
blendings of religion and superstition&mdash;in their attempts to avert drought and hailstorms and
obtain favourable weather for harvesting their crops. This chatty article deals with a number of
the most curious methods employed.</p></div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i0089dc.jpg" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> many parts of the world the
peasant and the countryman are
dependent for a whole year's daily
bread on the sort of weather Providence
is good enough to send them.
In England we are perhaps more independent
than any other land, for our much-abused
climate seldom runs to wild extremes. A
drought makes a serious difference certainly,
but it rarely ruins the entire crop. In the great
plains of Hungary and Roumania, however, a
winter without plentiful snow means a miserable
harvest, and under the blazing sun of summer a
drought there is a very much more tragic affair
than it is with us. In parts of Northern Italy
and the Tyrol what they most dread is not
drought, but the terrible hailstorms and tempests
which sweep down with sudden and relentless
fury upon the country-side, doing irreparable
damage in an incredibly short time.</p>

<p>It is interesting to notice the different ways in
which country-folk meet these trials. In England
after long drought we pray for rain in our
churches, and in most Roman Catholic countries
processions and pilgrimages are the order of the
day. In Macedonia the Greeks organize great
demonstrations in dry summers. A procession
of children visits all the local wells and springs,
accompanied by a maiden covered with garlands
and masses of flowers. This sounds as romantic
as our Queen of the May, and it could surprise
no one if, like Tennyson's heroine, she came to
a sad end, for at each of the stopping-places the
poor dear is drenched with water, whilst the
children sing a rhyming prayer for rain.</p>

WITH THE WEATHER.</p>

<p><em>From a Photograph.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>The Russian peasants say prayers to Elisha,
whom they consider a very potent rain-producer.
In some countries the images of the saints are
immersed in water when rain is wanted. On
the other hand, sometimes more rain falls than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
is needed, and in parts of Westphalia they say
that it is fatal to kill a swallow, for such a crime
will bring at least four weeks' deluge. Swallows
are considered lucky birds in that part of the
world, and if they are driven away all the
vegetables of the neighbourhood are sure to be
destroyed by frost.</p>

IN THE TYROL.</p>

</div>

<p>Weather-wise peasants know more or less at
what time hailstorms may be expected, and are
on the alert for danger-signals. In Northern
Italy cannons are fired off to disperse the
clouds, and enough powder is expended to
supply an army, while in some parts of France
they rely on bombs for the same purpose.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting methods of propitiating
the skies are to be found in parts of the
Tyrol, where the peasants are still refreshingly
simple and full of piety. The Salzkammergut
is one of the most interesting parts of Austria,
from an ethnological point of view. It teems
with ancient survivals and customs, and is a
treasure-house of legendary lore. A certain
imagination is displayed in all their tales; sly
humour, picturesque turns of phrases, and distinct
kindliness peep out everywhere. Few
Englishmen can live in the Tyrol without acquiring
an affection for the friendly folk. They are
like a lot of big children, with their yellow hair,
dancing blue eyes, and honest, sunburnt faces.
Moreover, they are thoroughgoing sportsmen,
first-rate at all games and athletics.</p>

<p>It is just about the time that the harvest is
ripening that the farmer begins to feel qualms
of anxiety concerning the weather, and keeps
his eye fixed on the sky. Any particularly black
clouds fill him with gloomy forebodings, for in
the course of a few moments the work of the
whole year may be swept away. Hoping to
shield his property from the powers of evil, he
employs all the means that his brain can devise,
and some of these are distinctly original and
curious.</p>

<p>As soon as low, rumbling thunder is heard in
the far-off hills the house-bells that are usually
found in the roofs of Tyrolese cottages begin
to ring. This is known as "Ringing in the
storm," and is considered an absolutely necessary
precaution. As the weather grows worse
you may hear the church bells all along the
valleys peal as well. Hailstorms in August are
most dreaded, and if the sky seems to indicate
that they are coming the priest is warned and
goes to stand at the door of the church, bearing
the Host, to pronounce the storm blessing.
Some priests are considered more gifted than
others in giving this blessing, and are supposed
to be able to stave off disaster by their peculiar
powers. They become popular far and wide
with the peasantry and are known as "storm-fighting
gentlemen."</p>

<p>Not only the priests, but also the bells of
certain churches have a great reputation for their
miraculous powers of checking bad weather.
The "witches' bell" in the wood at Pinzgau and
the one at Muhr, in Lungau, are famous in this
connection; while the two little bells of St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
Jacob's chapel in Kaprun Castle are supposed
to be very potent, both to avert hailstorms and
to frighten away witches. In past days the
peasants used to believe that many of the storms
were caused by witches who flew through the
air on broomsticks, scattering a powder as they
went and raising the blizzard. These were
called "manufactured storms."</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE GREAT "STORM CRUCIFIX" AT GR&Ouml;DIG, NEAR SALZBURG.</p>

<p><em>From a Photograph.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>A mischievous spirit called Zabera Jaggl is
said to bewail bitterly the difficulties that certain
bells put in his path
when he wants to ride
out on the wings of
the storm. He is
supposed to explain
his troubles thus:
"When I want to dash
through the pass of
Lueg the watch-dog
of Werpener will not
let me by"&mdash;the
watch-dog being the
great bell of Werpener
Castle, which was
always rung at the
approach of a storm
till the inhabitants of
Abtenau, near by, implored
the castle folk
to cease, since in
consequence of their
ringing all the tempest
swept on to
Abtenau. He goes on
to say: "If by any
chance the watch-dog
sleeps and I get safely
past Hell Bridge
across the Fritzbach,
then I knock up
against the big Altenmarker
hound (the
church bell of Altenmark),
and he will
not let me fly up the
forest of Kreisten,
where I ought to be
able to do great
damage. Supposing I
try to turn back and
ride to St. Martin's,
then the mastiff at the
inn howls and all the
whelps yap (the big
bell of the inn and the smaller ones found on
every house-top in St. Martin), and I must vent
my rage as best I can on Hell Mountain.
Wherever I turn a watch-dog faces me, till in
despair I climb the mighty mountain, tear the
trees down, and whirl around the summits,
lying down at last, dead tired, to rest on
Dachstein."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Dachstein is one of the great mountains of the Tyrol. Round
it endless legends and romances are woven.</p></div>

<p>A legend is told of the witch bell of Muhr,
in Lungau, which is of a peculiar shape, very
ancient in appearance, and very much chipped.
It hangs in the middle of the peal of bells in
the village church, and the story runs that the
devil once rode down to Muhr, determined to
enjoy himself, on the back of one of the biggest
hurricanes ever seen.
But the witches' bell
was rung for Ave
Maria, and every man
in the village fell on his
knees to pray for the
defeat of the Evil
One. So fervent were
their prayers and so
potent was the Ave
Maria bell that Satan
had to turn again.
The memory rankled,
and he determined to
revenge himself. Now
it happened that he
was in league with
one of the very worst
witches of the neighbourhood,
so he went
to give her instructions,
taking with him
a "hell hammer,"
which is a very infernal
weapon.
According to instructions,
she mounted
her broomstick at midnight
and flew away
to the belfry at Muhr.
She went straight to
the middle bell and
began hitting it with
all her might with the
hell hammer. But the
bell had been consecrated,
and resisted
all her efforts till just
before one o'clock,
when she managed
to chip it. At one
o'clock, however, the
hour for witches,
ghosts, and ghouls is
over, and so she had to pick up her hammer
and fly home again. Since that time, however,
the bell has lost most of its tone, and instead
of being heard for miles around it can now only
protect its own little parish.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>
<p>Among the sights that strike one most in
passing through the villages of the Salzkammergut
are the "storm crucifixes" and "hail
crosses." Sometimes you find them in the
church porches, sometimes in the graveyards,
and sometimes right out in the fields. They
stand about fifteen feet high, and are often
painted a reddish brown. There is almost
always a second and shorter plank nailed across
to form two extra arms. The figure of Christ
is usually carved out of wood in a primitive
fashion and highly coloured. All around, fixed
on to the four arms, are the emblems of the
Passion. These are the chains, the ladder, the
sword, the staves, the lantern, the cock, the dice,
the seamless robe, the sponge, the purse of
Judas, and many more. Village artists and
carvers frequently employ their winter evenings
in making every emblem that they can think of,
and they call them "Christ's weapons." On
the 3rd of May, the day of the finding of the
true Cross, they take them to the parish priest,
who blesses them and fixes them to the crucifix.</p>

<p><em>From a Photograph.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>The storm crucifix at Gr&ouml;dig, near Salzburg,
of which we give a photograph, is a very curious-looking
and primitive erection, standing in a
great open field behind the village. Another
photograph shows the hail cross of Unter
Eching, an immense thing over twenty feet
high. It does not bear the figure of our Lord,
but, on the other hand, there is a great collection
of "Christ's weapons." A leaden
cock always stands on the very top of all the
crucifixes. At the foot is usually found a little
pew where pious pilgrims frequently come to
pray for fine weather at harvest time, and close
by there will frequently be seen a frame of
wood across which is stretched a piece of wire.
Ten little wooden balls run along the wire
and are used by passers-by as a roadside
rosary.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>BUNCHES OF CATKINS ARE GIVEN AWAY IN THE CHURCHES ON
PALM SUNDAY, AND THESE ARE BURNT AT HARVEST-TIME TO
AVERT THE EVIL EFFECTS OF STORMS.</p>

<p><em>From a Photograph.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>The Tyrolese peasants have a strongly
superstitious as well as a religious side to
their characters. They invoke the aid of
Heaven, but they also place a good deal of
reliance in the help of amulets and charms.
It is only fair to say that these have usually
been blessed by the Church. For instance,
little bunches of catkins are blessed and given
away in the churches on Palm Sunday, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
are carefully preserved by
the country-folk till harvest
time. Then if the weather
becomes threatening and they
fear for their crops they fling
them into the fire to avert
the evil effects of the storm.</p>

<p>St. John's Wort or Hypericum
is regarded in most
countries as a plant with
every sort of wonderful
power. When lightning is
heard a bunch of it is hung
up in front of the window to
protect the house. If it is
picked before breakfast it is
almost infallible as a talisman
against lightning. St.
John's Wort gathered on
Midsummer Eve has marvellously
magical properties.</p>

<p>In some parts of the Tyrol
it is considered dangerous
to touch anyone who has
been struck by lightning till the priest has
said a prayer over the body. There are even
countries where it is considered a Divine favour
to be killed by lightning. Another protection
against being struck is the <em>Antlass Ei</em>, an egg
laid on the Thursday before Easter and then
placed in the roof.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>A "STORM CANDLE"&mdash;THESE ARE LIGHTED TO
DRIVE AWAY HAILSTORMS.</p>

<p><em>From a Photograph.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Summer hailstorms are feared more than anything
else, and in cases of severe hail the farmers
have a "hail Mass" performed in church. In
some places where storms are much dreaded
hail processions take place every Sunday from
Whitsuntide till the end of
August. When the big stones
come pelting down, black and
red "storm candles" are lighted.
These are kept in readiness for
such occasions in every well
regulated household.</p>

<p>I am told that in Belgium
blessed wax is burnt in times of
tempest. Among the various
recipes for avoiding danger the
following may be mentioned:
Never point your finger at a
thunderstorm. Do not eat or
drink while it lasts, but wrap yourself
in silk and put a candle under
the table. If you are caught by
a storm out of doors, go and lie
down under an elder tree. There
can then be no danger, for
the Cross was made of elder
wood.</p>

<p>Evidently the curious four-armed
cross given below must
have some special connection
with storms. It is a
little metal one intended for
personal use, and is inscribed
with mystic letters which
seem to have no meaning,
but must convey some subtle
sense of protection to the
wearer. In the middle is a
little medallion representing
the Host.</p>

THE PERSON CARRYING IT AGAINST
LIGHTNING AND TEMPEST.</p>

<p><em>From a Photograph.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>The photograph reproduced
on the next page
shows a "Letter of Protection"
against storms and
other evils, which is regarded
as a very potent charm by
the Tyrolese peasant. At the
top of the page on the
right-hand side, St. Anthony
of Padua is expelling
demons, unpleasant-looking
creatures with wings and
forked tails. Beneath him is St. Roch, protecting
from pests, and St. Benet from
sorcerers. Here again we see the cross with
four arms. The two heads are those of St.
Anastasius and St. Anastasia, both beheaded
martyrs, who are invoked against ghosts and
demons, and below them, in the corner, is St.
Francis Xavier, repulser of tempests. The
hands, feet, and heart of our Lord preserve from
serpents.</p>

<p>On the left hand side comes, first, St. Francis.
Below him are St. Michael and St. George, on
either side of a cross. St. George
preserves the believer from lapses
of faith and St. Michael keeps
malign spirits at a distance. The
three kings sitting in a row
beneath are invoked as protectors
of faithful travellers, and a very
evil-looking beast is seen grovelling
before the uplifted cross of
St. Ignatius. Right in the middle
is a particle of earth from the
Holy Land and three relics as
safeguards against fever, fire, and
lightning.</p>

<p>In the Tyrol the labourer
when sowing the seed scatters
his field with charcoal "for luck."
In Bohemia a splinter of wood
from which a coffin has been
made is stuck upright in the
fields to protect them from
sparrows. Another idea is that
a piece of wood from a coffin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
that has been dug up will defend crops from
caterpillars.</p>

</div>

<p>It is all very well for us to laugh at these
superstitions, but not so long ago in parts of
Scotland the farmers used to leave one portion
of their land uncropped year after year. The
spot was supposed to be dedicated to the devil,
and known as the good-man's croft or landlord's
acre. This was done so that the Evil One
should busy himself with it and leave the rest of
the place alone.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I should like to acknowledge
the kind help I have received from Mr. Adrian,
of Salzburg, the well known authority on folklore,
who furnished me with much information
for the purpose of this article.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By N. H. Crowell.</span>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An account of a tragic happening which abruptly broke in upon the peaceful routine of life in a
small American village. But for the important part played by the cross-country telephones it is
probable that the desperate trio with whom the narrative deals would have got clear away to
continue their career of crime.</p></div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i0095dc.jpg" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> fall of the year 1901 was remarkable
for the number of bank robberies
occurring in the States of Iowa,
South Dakota, and Minnesota. The
daring of the travelling bands of
criminals, commonly known as "yeggmen,"
manifested itself in frequent and generally
successful attempts on the vaults of various
financial institutions. In Iowa alone there had
been no fewer than thirteen robberies without a
single arrest up to the date of the Greenville
Bank case, which I am about to set forth.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning, November 16th, 1901,
a Greenville business man, rising early, was
attracted by a peculiar object lying in the middle
of the main thoroughfare. Greenville, being
only a small village of some three hundred
people, possessed but one principal street, which
ran through it from east to west. Upon
approaching the object the man saw that it was
the door of a bank-safe, and his surprise may be
imagined when, looking about him, he discovered
that the large glass front of the bank building
near by was entirely shattered.</p>

<p>In a very few moments he had gathered an
anxious crowd, and the more daring ventured
into the ruined building. It then became apparent
that the safe had been blown open by
nitroglycerine and its precious contents carried
away. On the bank counters were found a small
dark lantern, two bars of soap, some chisels, and
a silk handkerchief. The completeness of the
job showed it to have been the work of persons
who were either unacquainted with the terrific
power of the explosive used, or of extraordinary
daring and recklessness.</p>

<p>The cashier of the bank, Mr. E. B. Harrington,
lost no time in reaching the local telephone office,
from which point he immediately notified the
sheriff of the county at Spencer, nine miles
north, of the robbery, afterwards reporting it to
the town marshals of all the surrounding towns.</p>

<p>While thus engaged an employ&eacute; of the
Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway arrived with
the intelligence that the station tool-house had
been broken open and a hand-car taken therefrom.
The operators on the line at Spencer to
the north, and at Sioux Rapids to the south,
were at once called up, but both protested that
no hand-car had passed their station at any
hour of the night. The mystery was solved half
an hour later by the discovery of a broken hand-car
at the crossing of the Rock Island and
Minneapolis and St. Louis roads, one mile south
of the town. It was evident that the robbers, fleeing
on the car, had met with an accident and
had been forced to abandon it. The clue was
serviceable, however, in that it pointed out the
direction of the miscreants' escape, and the
officials at Marathon, Laurens, and Albert City&mdash;towns
in the general line of flight&mdash;were
promptly advised to be on the alert to intercept
all suspicious characters and hold them till
examined.</p>

<p>At this juncture a young lady employed in
the Spencer telephone exchange imparted the
information that she had observed three nasty-looking
strangers the night before eating a late
supper at a Spencer restaurant. The restaurant
proprietor corroborated this, and added that
one of the men was of very dark complexion,
and, in his judgment, was a mulatto.</p>

<p>The wires were again resorted to and neighbouring
officials given the fresh information.
At nine o'clock on the morning of the robbery
the marshals of every place within a radius of
forty miles were in possession of the facts, and
had trusted deputies guarding all approaches to
their respective towns. Assuming it to be a fact
that the robbery had been committed by two
white men and one black man, who were now
travelling on foot in a south-easterly direction, it
seemed but a question of hours before they
would be halted by some one of the representatives
of the law.</p>

<p>An hour passed by, then two, and a third.
Not a word came from Marathon, the nearest
town in the line of flight. It was impossible for
the men to escape by train, as all dep&ocirc;ts were
under close surveillance; it was equally impossible
to conceal themselves in a farming
community so thickly inhabited as the one
they were now traversing. It appeared inevitable,
therefore, that their whereabouts must soon be
reported.</p>

<p>Just before noon a farmer living five miles east
of Sioux Rapids drove into that town and, upon
being questioned, stated that he had given three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
strangers breakfast less than an hour before. He
stated that one was a negro, and that all three
were well armed and were apparently desperate
characters. Upon being informed that the trio
had burglarized the Greenville Bank, the farmer
was considerably surprised, but was able to give
a minute description of the robbers to the
marshal.</p>

<p>It being now evident that the men were
heading for Albert City, a small town on the
Milwaukee railroad, fifteen miles to the south-east,
Marshal Snyder, of Sioux Rapids, lost no
time in picking a posse to aid him in the capture
of the desperate men. In twenty minutes he,
with three others, whirled away in a carriage
drawn by the fleetest team in the town. Marshal
Snyder knew that a freight train
was due to leave Albert City
shortly after the dinner-hour,
and he hoped to reach the dep&ocirc;t
in time to thwart this method of
escape.</p>

<p>While Snyder and his deputies
were speeding toward Albert
City, the town marshal of that
little place, Mr. C. J. Lodine,
received definite word by telephone
that the robbers were
moving in his direction. Barely
had he hung up the instrument
when he learnt that three men
answering the descriptions sent
out were in the waiting-room of
the Albert City dep&ocirc;t, awaiting
the arrival of the freight train,
concerning which they had been
questioning the agent.</p>

<p>Marshal Lodine, a brave and
efficient officer, knew that there
was no time to lose. The train
was due in a very few minutes,
and he felt that upon him devolved
the success or failure of
all the efforts that had been put
forth for the capture of the
three criminals.</p>

<p>Seizing a Winchester rifle, he
started out to secure men to
assist him in the capture. No
one refused his call. He darted
into a forage store, and the
proprietor grasped his hat and
followed readily. A doctor's
office came next, and the
physician was added to the little
party. At the bank he secured
the cashier, while a farmer who
was hitching up his team joined
him with alacrity. In the space
of ten minutes Lodine had five armed and determined
men behind him, and speedily made his
way to the waiting-room of the little dep&ocirc;t.</p>

<p>Far to the north sounded the whistle of the
approaching freight train, and the posse stepped
a trifle faster at its summons. They knew the
crucial moment was soon to arrive.</p>

<p>Down the length of the narrow platform they
walked and approached the door of the waiting-room.
With his men close at his back Marshal
Lodine entered, and located his men seated in
the corner of the room. Rifle in hand, he took
a step in their direction and commanded:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hands up! We want you!"</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"THE THREE MEN WHIPPED OUT REVOLVERS AND OPENED A FURIOUS FIRE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Immediately, without warning or replying,
the three men whipped out revolvers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
opened a furious fire. Marshal Lodine was hit
in the body and staggered out on to the platform,
where he dropped the rifle. Mr. M. H.
Conlin, a farmer, snatched it up and ran for
cover from the galling fusillade that was being
poured in his direction.</p>

<p>The posse, unprepared for such an unexpected
onslaught, scattered wildly, and as they
ran the desperadoes emerged upon the platform
and fired repeatedly upon them. Lodine, sorely
wounded, secreted himself near
the dep&ocirc;t, while Conlin and the
forage-store proprietor, John Sundblad,
dropped behind a pile of
rocks. Conlin was uninjured, but
a bullet found poor Sundblad,
and he fell writhing in agony.</p>

DIED FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE WOUND RECEIVED
IN THE FIGHT.</p>

<p><em>From a Photograph.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Having cleared the field, the
robbers ran across the railroad
tracks and entered a barn belonging
to one Johnson. Finding a
horse therein, one of the white
men led it out and began a
hurried attempt to hitch it up to
a buggy standing near, being protected
in his efforts by the negro,
who stood by firing at every
hiding-place where lurked a
member of the posse.</p>

<p>From his cover behind the
rock-pile Farmer Conlin began
shooting at the horse, intending to kill it
and thus prevent escape by that means.
In his excitement, and being under a severe
fire, Conlin was unsuccessful, and desisted. A
moment later, however, as the men were about
to leap into the buggy, he resolved to make one
more effort. At the crack of his rifle the white
man dropped to the earth, struck squarely in
the breast. The negro at once ran up and stripped
his fallen comrade of his guns and money.</p>

<p>At this point the freight train drew in and
separated the combatants. A delay ensued,
during which the two remaining robbers leaped
into a farmer's wagon and compelled him to
drive north at breakneck speed. As rapidly as
was possible three rigs were dispatched in hot
pursuit, and the chase became so warm that the
fleeing men were forced to stop a single rig
driven by two boys, whom they threw out and
thus continued their flight. This rig was soon
exchanged for another, a lady's vehicle being
commandeered in this instance. This team
failed them shortly, and a farmer, fixing fence
along the highway, was next required to deliver
his team. Stripping the harness off, the men
mounted the animals bareback and started away
at a gallop. The horse ridden by the negro,
however, suddenly "bucked" and threw his
rider off. He was unable to mount, and, seeing
the pursuers approaching, dropped the reins and
turned into a cornfield at one side of the road.
His partner, observing this, also dropped off his
horse and dashed into the cornfield.</p>

<p>The men were now practically cornered.
From the east the posse from Marathon was just
in sight, and would have intercepted them in
another mile.</p>

<p>Conlin, with the Winchester rifle, sent big
bullets screaming through the
corn-shocks (sheaves), and as the
field was not an extensive one
the men were in considerable
danger of being struck down
unless they surrendered, and this
they finally decided to do. The
desperadoes, having thrown down
their guns, were directed to approach
with their hands in the air.
Thereupon they were securely
tied with straps taken from the
harness.</p>

<p>At this moment Farmer Conlin
discovered that he had fired his
last cartridge. Brooks, the negro,
then stated that had he known
this a moment before he would
never have been taken, as it was
the fear of the big rifle alone that
had caused them to surrender.</p>

<p>The two robbers were driven rapidly back to
Albert City, at which place Marshal Snyder had
arrived. He searched the men, and, not satisfied
with a superficial examination revealing
more guns and ammunition, ordered the men to
strip. This they did with evident reluctance.
Around the negro's neck was tied a razor and a
bag containing a quantity of some liquid. As
Snyder removed the latter the negro remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Be careful of that; it's dangerous!"</p>

<p>Needless to say this liquid was nitroglycerine,
and as there was enough of it to have blown off
at least twelve safe-doors it is not difficult to
understand the ferocious nerve of the man who
carried it when exposed to bullets and the
eccentricities of bucking horses.</p>

<p>The examination over, the negro hastily
snatched up his under-garments and began
donning them hurriedly. This aroused Snyder's
suspicion further, and realizing the calibre of the
men with whom he was dealing he searched the
garments. Sewn in the seams of the shirt he
found two fine saws nearly twelve inches in
length, with which he cut an iron stove-poker as
easily as a dull knife cuts cheese. This discovery
was a serious one for the negro, and his spirits
fell noticeably thereafter.</p>

<p>The men were now turned over to the sheriff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
and deputies who had arrived from Storm Lake,
and by them taken to that city and lodged in the
county jail.</p>

</div>

<p>John Sundblad died on Sunday afternoon from
the effects of the wound received in the fight,
and Marshal Lodine, after battling bravely for
eight days, also succumbed to his injuries. The
robber shot by Farmer Conlin lingered until
Sunday noon, and before dying confessed that
it was he and his companions who had robbed
the Greenville Bank. He stated that his name
was Dolan, although he was apparently of Italian
descent.</p>

<p>The two surviving men, giving the names of
Albert Phillips and Louis Brooks, were tried
for murder, found guilty, and sentenced to be
hanged.</p>

<p>Upon appeal to the Supreme Court errors
were found, and a new trial granted the
accused. They were found guilty of manslaughter
at this trial and sentenced to life
imprisonment at hard work. At the present
time they are in the Iowa State Penitentiary at
Anamosa.</p>

<p>The money stolen from the bank was subsequently
recovered, being found concealed in
the field where the desperate men made their
last stand.</p>

beasts have a vitality that triumphs over a stray
bullet or more unless lodged in a vital region, and
when wounded their retaliation is redoubtable and
easily fatal. In Karelen the bear is yet regarded
as a noxious horror. The great black-haired

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Near</span> Ploumanach, in Brittany, there
is one of the most curious shrines in
Europe. This is the chapel of St.
Guirec, a tiny, picturesque building
of the twelfth century. It stands on a
rock in the bay, and at high tide is surrounded by
the waves. Inside is a wooden statue of St. Guirec
in a deplorable state, for it is simply riddled with
tiny holes. The reason for this sad state of
things is that the fishermen's daughters have a
strong superstition that if they come to pray at
the shrine and stick a pin into poor St. Guirec
they are certain to get married within the year.
If the hapless saint gives himself a shake during
the night and the pin drops out, it is an infallible
sign that everything will go well.</p>

<p>The extraordinary photograph on the next
page shows what may well be called a
"human Catharine-wheel." This is to be seen
at the annual feast of the Totonaco Indians
at Papantla, in the State of Vera Cruz, Mexico.
Wearing huge, highly-coloured erections&mdash;made
from the bark of a tree&mdash;on their heads, four
men take their positions on the arms of the mill
and proceed to make it rotate, gradually working
up to a speed of forty or fifty revolutions a
minute, while the crowd cheer excitedly. This
ranks as "fun," but must be decidedly warm
work for the performers, who, to guard against
the results of giddiness, are strapped by the
legs. The two Indians seen in the foreground
are wearing grotesque masks.</p>

<p>The only brass band
in the world whose
members are deaf and
dumb is depicted in the
photograph reproduced
below. This remarkable band belongs to the
New York Institution for the Deaf and Dumb.
To teach a person who is afflicted in this way
to play an instrument
and get him to understand
something of
musical notation would
appear at first an impossible
task, and it
was only accomplished
after many months of
patience. First of all
the players were taught
how to blow the fife,
the simplest of all wind
instruments. The next
step was more intricate.
By the use of certain
fingers the players were
made to produce given
notes, and in this way
various tones were
taught and committed
to memory. Being of
necessity taught with
the utmost exactness,
the pupils developed
a confidence of execution not found in the
average musical student. Certain rules were
laid down, which the deaf-mute had to follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
explicitly, and the result
was absolute correctness
in playing.</p>

<p>It is difficult for those
who have not had ocular
demonstration to credit the
extraordinary capacity of
snakes for absorbing large
animals. The striking
photograph we next reproduce
was taken in the Zoo
at Perth, Western Australia,
and shows a python
which endeavoured to dine
not wisely but too well.
He killed a goat, and
commenced to swallow it
bodily, as is the pleasing
habit of these great
snakes. Poor "Billy,"
however, had his revenge,
for he stuck in the reptile's
throat, capacious
though it was, and all
the python's efforts
to dislodge him failed.
The result, of course, was distinctly unfortunate
for the snake. When the curator went
his rounds the following day he discovered
the monster quite dead, with the goat's hind
legs sticking out of his mouth, as shown in
the snapshot.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
